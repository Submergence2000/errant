Dear Paul !
I have n't written to you for ages but I was very busy because of the exams at the University .
What about you ?
What 's new in Brazil ?
As you know , my friend John asked me to help him with the organization at the concert , which was performed last month .
So I was there something like staff .
My work consisted of making press advertising , providing all tickets , food for musicians and things like that .
I got two free V. I. P tickets , so I took my girlfriend and we were there together .
When the concert finished , we went to the cloakroom to get signatures from the musicians .
I felt like a star !
Crowded of people were waiting in front of the cloakroom for the signatures , but only me and my sweet girlfriend got them .
People were so envious ... I liked it !
It was a fantastic experience .
Next time I would like to do something similar and you should try it as well .
You will earn nice money and you will have cultural experience .
It 's a dual effect !
Hope to see you soon John
The advertising is everywhere .
There are adds to TV , radio , buses , streets ...
In spite of this range of media , the TV continues to be the most important means of communication .
A lot of people think that there are too many adds on television , but is it like that ?
On the one hand , it 's true that one programme or series which we see has a lot of mentions of products or services .
There can be people tired of so many advertising contents but this is completely necessary .
There are a lot of products which have to be announced and a lot of messages to report to people .
The TV is the most accessible way of communication and people can see the message in this way .
In addition , behind one add there are a lot of things : one industry .
In one add , there are , for example , the publicist 's work , companies ' investments , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds to TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
My favourite season of the year is summer .
Why am I making this choice you can clearly ask ? I love the sun and good weather .
Yes , it is true that during summer the temperature is very hot and you can rarely stay near the sun because you finish being burnt by the sun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good moment to enjoy little things life gives us and have fun with them .
During summer I love to go to the beach and have sunbathing with my friends other than having fun with them playing volleyball or running inside the water of the sea !
I think those activities are very regenerating and they make you forget about all the warmth of summer .
Furthermore , you can sleep more than the other days of the year and this makes you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore nature during summer too .
The wonderful colours of flowers with the sunshine are fabulous .
Dear USA SUMMER CAMPS , I saw your advertisement in the USA and I 'm very interested in the position of childminder you are advertising .
I 'm eighteen years old and I 'm doing a language translation degree at university at the moment . That 's why I need to work in order to pay my fee .
I have some experience working with children of all ages . Besides , I do n't mind hard work and I learn quickly .
Also I 've just got my FCE certificate this year but it would help me a lot if I practised my English in a native country .
I consider myself really active , sociable , well - organized and above all patient , therefore I think I 'm suitable for this job as I can adapt to any kind of situation or environment , especially working overseas , plus it would be a nice experience because I would meet new people and a different culture .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully , Teresa Wysocki
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
He finally , after 5 years , won a swimming competition .
It was really important for him because he has been training for 5 long years , since he was 15 and he has n't got any achievements .
He was very happy and he decided to celebrate .
He invited all his friends from the team and had a party .
Tom wanted Mel , his girlfriend , to come too .
She was really proud of him .
She was dreaming about being his wife .
She wanted to be his wife so bad .
But he did n't love her enough .
He wanted to break up with her at that party .
He was waiting 2 hours for her .
He hated that she was always late .
That was the main reason he wanted to end it up .
When Mel came she looked gorgeous .
And when he saw her , his heart started to beat faster and faster .
But time 's up .
He got closer to her and told her everything .
Mel looked sadly at Tom , then said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and got out of his home .
He followed and apologized to her .
He said he was drunk and did n't know what he was saying .
Then he hugged her .
He said he loved her and kissed her forehead .
He had to stay with her because of ... the baby .
He could n't just leave her carrying his baby !
No !
He has never acted like this .
He knew that he had to stay with her for the rest of his life and raise the baby .
He decided to give up swimming and started to take care of Mel .
One day Mel was feeling really bad so Tom took her to the hospital .
He felt that something bad was going to happen .
And he was right .
Mel has lost the baby .
Tom had to make a hard decision .
His life was going to change .
Mel was crying all day and Tom could n't stand it .
He had broken up with Mel and it made her much more sad .
He did n't care .
He thought it was her fault that she had lost their little human .
Gliding in the waves Even if I am not very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practise is swimming .
The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without weight , able to do a lot of movement that is impossible while in the air , is a wonderful state of mind .
I started to go swimming in the pool because I was n't able to swim at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have been taking lessons for six months , so I improved my abilities so much .
If you are not a good swimmer , you lose a large part of the pleasure of enjoying the water , both in the sea or in the pool .
Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because it is fairly simple and it can give a lot of satisfaction !
Your efforts will be prized for succeeding , and you can obtain them with practice .
Introduction
This report will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
Activities to kill time
As our town is well - known for our magnificent beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign or local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing on the beach or canoening and aquatic skiing on the Olympic Canal .
These activities are the most popular and the most expensive too .
However , I fully recommend them , especially for sporty , adventurous and young people .
Other ideas to have fun In Castelldefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : free zumba masterclass , yoga beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are a library group , theatre ...
As I said , these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .
Remendation
So , finally I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and the newest .
If you tried all the activities , you would have a great time here , in Castelldefels !
Hi Jane ,
How are you ? I was glad to hear from you .
I 'm writing to tell you the best way to arrive in Salou .
You will come to the Reus airport , right ?
Well , the airport is located just outside Reus . It 's small but it has a lot of services and transport .
You have to take a bus because it is more economical than taking a taxi .
The bus stops at the Salou bus station .
When you get off the bus , you should ask someone for Spring Street .
It 's near there .
You can walk to my house .
Moreover I am sending you a map in order to locate the street .
This is my address : 4 Spruce Avenue .
I 'm planning your visit .
I 'd like to visit museums , monuments and go clubbing with you .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Best Regards , Mary Dear Sergio Garca A , My name is Guillermo Sedillo Tórrez .
I am an Engineer of Execution in Mines , entitled in the " Instituto Profesional Virginio Gómez " .
I am particularly interested and I am competent to apply for the post of Chief of Operations at the new underground project Chiquicamata .
In the first place , my qualities and professional skills seem to suit the requirements of your company .
On the other hand , I have the theoretical knowledge to use new technologies this great project requires .
I am also able to lead the operations of the project responsibly and through team work to achieve the objective and to continue with the prestige that your company has .
My work experience is very outstanding due to the fact that I had the privilege of belonging to the " Minera El Teniente " as shift manager , Chief of operations at " Minera Andina " and in the evaluation department of CODELCO projects .
I really appreciate your time and consideration .
It would be a pleasure to discuss personally why I am qualified for this position .
I expect a prompt response from the company .
Without further ado , I remain yours .
Guillermo Sedillo Tórrez Nowadays there are many people that are learning foreign languages . For me it is a good thing that more people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that people who know how to speak foreign languages have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being promoted .
On the other hand , there are more benefits . For example , if you want to travel to another country , it is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand everything without complications .
Finally , learning another language gives the learner the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture .
Today globalization is bringing the world closer . That means that there are more possibilities to have contact with other cultures . For example , in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive in different aspects , so if you have the positivity of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .
A LETTER OF COMPLAINT Julio Camarillo Montano Avenue no 2 Post Code 10237 Cáceres August,23 rd 2014 Dear Sir / Madam , I am writing to complain about a recent package I received on Monday last week .
I ordered two batteries model 002545 because my mobile needs this kind of battery , but I have only received one battery model 001212 .
One month ago I ordered two batteries , model 002545 , on your online website .
I have a mobile model , Nokia 1214 , which needs batteries , model 002545 .
The delivery was wrong , so now I am in a huge hurry because I need my mobile to work every day .
If I do n't have a mobile I will not be able to work .
To resolve the problem I would like to receive the batteries by express post .

Yours faithfully , Julio Camarillo
The aim of this report is to evaluate both bad effects and good effects from the users ' opinions in the Active Leisure Club in the last time .
First , people in this area have actually found a suitable place to enjoy their time through a wide range of activities , games which are held creatively and effectively and have been suitable for different ages .
Besides , it has enough modern facilities to serve the users in the peak hours and the guiders are everywhere and ready to give help .
However , the only thing that we dislike with the purpose of making more people join the club , because of its good points , I highly recommend that they should arrange the time suitably and also they hold the acivities to avoid the problems Given is a diagram introducing the procedures of making bank notes .
Designing the bank notes is the first and indispensable step .
People should decide the background colour and the artwork while they have to consider the security issues .
Then , skilled machinists would prepare the metal plates in order to go to the next step .
The third section is to print the prepared bank notes .
Usually there will be 50 ban notes per sheet .
The colour will print on both sides and every note has their unique ink and the images will be slightly raised .
After that , it comes to the most significant stage , which is inspecting the quality of the printed sheets .
People usually divide the quality into three parts : good quality , partially damaged , and bad sheets .
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets but still good , people will cut them separately and pack them together in order to dispact and distribute the bank notes .
If the partially damaged sheets are bad , they will be treated as bad sheets , which will be securely destroyed .
In conclusion , the diagram gives quite an explicit process of making bank notes .
Even though it seems to be easy to make them , every step needs people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect bank notes for everyone .
A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE Beginings Everything began a few years before , when Alfred ,
The Major read an article about the importance of the surroundings in health and happiness of people .
He started to think about how he could get better in our lives and he found a solution .
A concerned population
While youngsters spend their time trying to get concerned with the oldest people from de village about the importance of taking care of our surroundings , middle - aged people planted many trees around the village and cleaned the floor of our public places , making it a more attractive place to live than we used to have .
Easy recycling Local authorities helped with this initiative to create some places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center with the purpose of giving a new life to our waste .
The results
As a result of this attitude , since Alfred had this great idea , we enjoy one of the cleanest villages in the area .
People now are worried about the future of our planet and an association has been created in order to promote the care of our planet . Green Planet is called .
We want a happy Earth .
Hello Luis Blanco , I 'm writing to you about the staff recruitment for the " New Cloud Generation " project .
So we need your help with some questions about the process .
For your information , we are looking for people with three years of experience in similar projects , who are engineers and also have high team work skills .
We also value that they have specialised studies in Cloud technology , and hosting management .
However , it 's possible that we do n't find enough people with that profile , so we can accept people with one year of experience .
Is it possible to have a meeting this week ?
When and where do you prefer ?
( Remember that I work from 8 a.m to 6 p.m ) I suggest we can do the meeting at your office , so you do n't have to move to another place .
Finally I need you to prepare some profiles that you think the staff of New Cloud Generation should have , and please tell me if you find another different request than I told you before in that e - mail .
Please , answer me with the information as soon as possible .
igo Ojeda .
Dear Paul ,
What 's up ?
Do you remember when I told you I had been helped at a concert ?
It was a really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoyed that very much .
You probably would n't believe me but I met all the members of the Dem band . I talked to them and we had lunch together . They 're very nice men .
Because of helping them I had the best place during the concert and I have their authographs on the newest record .
I did n't have many duties and none of them were unpleasant .
In general , I had only one duty , which was checking the quest list , above that I had to help in the cleaning area after the concert .
But that concert was worth my work , so I hope I will be invited to their next event .
Working for them was a real pleasure .
I suppose we 'll see each other soon and I 'll be capable of talking to you about this experience .
Love , Dominika Report :
The aim of this report is to give you my personal point of view of the course I did in your branch in Madrid last month .
In addition , I would like to give you some suggestions . I think it would be worth it to take into account for the next course it will take place next year .
First , I would like to stand out from the outstanding classmates there were in class .
They were not only really clever people but also excellent co - workers .
Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning any subject , even English .
Second , the teachers were really good skills to teach .
They managed to encourage all of us every day .
This way we made the most of us and never gave up on improving our English level .
Third , phonetic classes scheduled for Fridays came really in handy .
They helped me to pronounce words better than before starting the course .
However , in my opinion , there should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher 's team .
This way we were able to hear a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practising .
To wrap up the report just say that on the whole the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to signing it again next year .
Yours sincerely , Juan Orozco . I am keen on cinema , thus I love to watch all types of movies .
But , what films are on my Top 100 list ?
In my opinion , Babel is a fascinating film with a dramatic and thrilling storyline that is the top 100 best movies .
I really enjoy it because the plot is original and it shows different life stories of moving characters .
In addition , I think that the settings are very realistic and the actors gave a great performance .
Therefore , I recommend that drama genre lovers watch Babel as its message will move you .
It reveals that our feelings cross the boundaries of all cultures and we are connected to each other .
My name is Mohamed El - Shamoun .
I am 20 years old , living in Port - Said , Egypt .
I am a student in the 3rd year of the faculty of medicine , Port - Said University .
My father works as a teacher and so does my mother .
I have one brother and one sister .
I have been doing Judo for the past 11 years with a lot of prizes .
My hobbies are travelling , reading stories and writing my thoughts .
I am interested in scientific research and analyzing information , so I am taking a lot of courses and training in this field as I want to be one of the greatest researchers in the world in addition to becoming a member of the World Health Organization ( OMS ) .
It is n't just a dream in my mind but I work hard to make this dream come true .
For the last two years , I worked in many places , such as a pharmacy , a restaurant and a water purification company .
I believe that work is everything and experience can make miracles in our life , so I chose this program as I want to learn and study , I want to know more and more .
In my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer but when I changed my career to medicine , I realized that Allah chose the best for me and for my personality .
When I work anything I feel that I have the world in my hand so I can do anything for people .
One of my goals in life is to invent an effective drug for those incurable like cancer , AIDS and hepatitis .
I asked myself many times what is the aim of our life ?
And what are the benefits of work and study ?
But if you see your world and realize it well , it will be deserved from everyone to work so hard and achieve their hopes .
I learnt from Research that you can do everything at any time . In addition , a little tired can change life for the better .
I like travelling and visiting new places in my country and my dream is to travel to all the countries in the world also . I attended a lot of conferences in my field so I think this program is a chance for experience which will help and inspire me for the community services and development of my society as I hope to come back and teach others what I learn .
I am writing with reference to the post of job as a camp monitor that you require in summer .
I saw your advert this morning and I am really interested in it .
Although I am a young girl , I think I am a qualified person for the post .
I am a preschool teacher and I have experience looking after children from 3 to twelve years old .
I considered myself quite patient and fun that , in my opinion , they are two qualities highly necessary for this kind of job .
I am good at working in a team too .
I do not like to be or feel alone . This could be one of my great weaknesses .
I really love being with people all the time .
I do not think being young will be a problem .
Instead I believe it is an advantage .
Young people are usually hard - working and active people .
If you require any further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I enclose my curriculum vitae with my telephone number .
I would be grateful if you could give me an interview at your earliest convenience .
I would really appreciate it because I am looking forward to starting work .
Is there a future for privately owned cars ?
To be honest , I am not sure .
Although privately owned cars are more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport in the future .
Most people today realize that in our cities and on our planet there is an increasing problem of space and pollution .
Carbon - based fuels will not last forever .
I would say that most probably private care is not " sustainable " in the long term , and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow by a staggering 3 billion human beings .
I know that it is nice to dream of a future of technological people flying around , each of them with their own private small helicopter .
But it is not going to happen .
I guess that in our future there will be no helicopters , and not even cars .
States and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative .
But the price of independent transport will grow dramatically .
I reckon that that will change the habits of the public .
Even though we will have to read the timetable and to learn again to be on time , the nice old train could become important again .
Imagine this picture : in the first class of this semester , students are yawning and do not pay attention to the teacher ; while the teacher asks for the answer , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they studied in last semester .
Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because , after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because of the long vacation will let students have fun instead of studying , and partly because some difficult courses should be continually studying .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
More reasons and detail will be shed light on in the following paragraphs .
To begin with , there is a general consensus , students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break time .
For example , in history class , the history teacher has to repeat teaching the history of North America before he starts to teach the history of South America at the beginning of the semester .
It is very wasting time and not efficient .
Next to go would be , students get used to relaxing by having no study and homework in the long vacation .
For example , when the semester starts , students can not get away from the sunshine , the beach , and travelling .
In the class , students will recall the joyful time they had instead of paying attention to the teacher .
Last but not least , some difficult courses should be continually studied rather than having a long break time .
For instance , learning English should be a daily education . If you have a long time without learning English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
In a nutshell , based on the aforementioned , I totally agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
My favourite sport is soccer .
I have enjoyed this sport since I was a child . I always remember when my father and my brother taught me to play it .
My father was a professional soccer player , so I think that I inherited this love for soccer .
I played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
I always enjoy playing soccer because when I am on the playing field I forget all the problems .
I like to speak with my team partners .
Together we analyze the rival team and we choose a strategy to win the match . When I play bad I feel nervous but my teammates give me their unconditional support . That is priceless .
I know health is very important , so if you practise this sport there is a big probability that you are healthy .
So if you are starting this sport , you have to do it because you really like it .
If you do n't like it , there are many options to practise whatever sports .
Soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it becomes .
In this way , you have to be prepared for any problem .
Finally , I advise that you enjoy playing this awesome sport .
On my vacation I went to New York .
I also went to the amazing Niagara Falls .
Something that made me happy was to see my family .
On September 12 th,2014 I went to New York City .
On the fly I was very happy because I received a lot of food .
The flight was approximately five hours where I watched beautiful movies .
When I arrived my uncle was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug .
We went to Long Island because he lives there .
He has a really nice house and I was happy to see my little cousin " Angel " who looks just like me .
In New York I eat so much . I also went to the city where they never sleep , Manhattan .
My uncle had the awesome idea of going to Niagara Falls .
We went in the car and it was about 8 hours long .
Finally we arrived in Niagara Falls city , which looked like a ghost place .
It does not have too much to do but there were the falls .
I was amazed at how huge the falls were .
They were incredible , amazing and beautiful .
I take too many photos because you do n't visit places like that every day .
Something that made me very happy was to visit my family .
My uncle Juan lives in the United States of America and I was very glad to hug him because I miss him a lot .
My cousin Angel was very happy to see me and me too . We are like siblings .
My aunt gave me a lot of presents because she says they do not see me frequently and many other parts of my family .
In conclusion I have a perfect vacation where I see new things , visit awesome places like Niagara Falls and Time Square , receive a lot of presents and , especially , eat a lot of delicious food .
Most attending students to Universities are out of the city where they used to live , so , they need accommodation to live through their study years .
Most universities provide cheap accommodation such as shared rooms and dormitories for their students to lower living costs , where most students have a low income .
Other students who may have family financial support prefer to hire apartments to live independently . Sharing houses or rooms has many advantages , such as being cheap , safe , close to the university , and learning how to share everything with others .
Saving money and time will be more obvious in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four times hiring an apartment , and because it will be closer to the university , saving money and time is more efficient by reducing transportation costs .
In spite of all these benefits , I prefer - if I can - to live in an apartment where the personality is very important for me .
Many years ago , I shared a friend in a room for a few months during a course outside my country . These days , where I am worse during my life , he was dirty , speaking loudly all the time and did not share the budget of eating .
Living alone will grant me the freedom to live by the way that I choose and am still friendly with all the others without exceeding the privacy of my friends . This matter will not be achieved when living in shared rooms . They annoying me Although
The federal government , which is decided as the role of the USA , has many benefits . According to the reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .
The power of federalism , which has more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture where it may create some conflicts between the states .
An example of that is the marriage of homosexuals where some states admit this marriage , others do n't .
Also , the reading passage declares that even the federal government let each state function independently , it still controls the main decisions . This case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of the federal government to stop illegal immigration to the USA through the Nevada desert . Also , the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the states and the federal blame each other for the increase in unemployment in some states .
In conclusion , the federal government , which gives freedom and power , causes many problems , such as no single policy and confusion in responsibility .
Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .
I think that any type of trip is exciting but also has their frustrating moments .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico , I would give two important advice ; first try to get alone with a travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead of criticizing the spicy flavor .
People say that on every voyage people suffer from different moments of the trip : arriving , getting away to the frustration of an unknown place , getting alone with your trip companion , success as a traveler and arriving home triumphally .
In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico , I suggest that the traveler find a way to get alone with his or her companion .
This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit another city .
As an example , if you are able to get alone with your travel companion , you can enjoy each moment of the trip , exchange some pictures , eat together , and visit places with common interests such as museums or malls .
Another piece of advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is that they enjoy Mexican food .
Mexican food has a lot of tasting dishes from different states of the country .
For example , there are a lot of American people that do n't like spicy food and also most of the time could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their food .
As advice I would suggest you ask for sauces with lower pepper .
In this way , the visitors will be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious flavor that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I offered two important advice for visitors coming to my country :
Try to get alone with their companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !
After the Internet was invented and revealed for the first time on August 29 th 1969 , Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced face - to - face communication .
SMS such as Facebook send out 700.000 messages , and 170.000
Tweets are publicized on Twitter each 60 seconds .
Unsurprisingly , the social consequences of Facebook and Twitter play an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general are not likely to have their own personal privacy because there is a possibility of a cycle of bullying .
This essay will force on the benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments on the potential future of these implications .
Communicating can be achieved , regardless of distance , through Facebook and Twitter .
The benefit of being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and in places where their negative feelings are expressed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one 's own feelings within the network ( through wall posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert,2013 ) .
That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook interacts with others by sharing their mood , and receiving responses .
Thirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
Knowledge about the members increases continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their same interests via the social network . ( Emerald Group Publishing,2013 ) .
Finally , people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter .
For instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see every daily activity which is posted by them .
However , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a high potential of being purposely aggressive toward someone .
However , information which appears on Facebook or Twitter is easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily respond as a public opinion .
However , information which appears on Facebook or Twitter is easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily respond as a public opinion .
Mostly , Facebook users expect their friend to respond or pay attention to what they are doing .
In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comments .
First of all , people can post any racist comments which target a specific group or person .
For example , after the premier of The Hunger Games was released , a fan posted an onset racist tweet saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by a Black person ( Rain Rauch and Schanz,2013 ) .
Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems involved with cycle - bullying , cycle - blankling , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Merten,2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) reports a case of continuous disturbing a woman from a man called Mr.
X " admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on charges of stalking harassment , trespassing and telephone harassment " ( pp.576 . e 1 - 576 . e 2 ) .
Potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace face - to - face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without having to view each other 's appearances .
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than have to call them .
The possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communication skills that they have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook and Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem .
For example , controlling what posts should be sent by adding more privacy options .
However , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention to the fact that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoiding using it most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits of using Facebook and Twitter are that people can communicate and be connected to their friends frequently .
Also , people can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel .
In contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
Possibly , users might express aggressive toward each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photography classes for everyone Introduction Teenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Facebook , Instagram , Pinterest , etc .
Photographs are included on all of those sites .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capture special moments like birthdays , travels , special occasions , etc .
As a new college subject
This practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation .
However , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be considered as learning to draw .
Both skills are required in today 's world and are necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .
The reasons recent studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs have been taken per person in the world , especially in the latest generations ' lives ( teenagers and kids ) .
This increase is related to the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .
Also , photography is considered as a type of art , so it requires knowledge of special skills , techniques and knowledge .
What lovely weather today !
What a wonderful day !
There is April now and finally spring came .
A bright sun is shining , the snow melted away in March .
The first spring birds came back from the warm countries .
They are singing funny and building their nests .
People look happier .
They are feeling tired after a long snowy winter .
We set our clock forward one hour in March .
The summertime was first introduced in England in 1908 .
The days become longer and the nights get shorter and lighter .
We usually set our clock back an hour in October .
A lot of people are happy , because they can sleep ( for ) one hour more .
Hockey as a lifestyle . Although all sports help you to have a healthy life , hockey provides you with more than just being healthy or fit .
What do you think of whenever you choose a sport ?
Do you think that your lifestyle will improve ?
Well you are mistaken .
For doing different kinds of sports , you need to be skilled or willing to try new things .
What if you do n't have none of those requirements ?
Then you know hockey is the opener . Hockey is a sport I have played for many years and it turned out to be my favorite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . In simple words , it 's a team sport .
However , it 's not always as simple as it sounds .
You have to train five days a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
On the other hand I enjoy every second of it .
Through all my life I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has become a lifestyle for me .
Why will I recommend this to you ?
It would definitely help you to grow and improve as a person .
Hockey will change the way you see the world and you are going to start seeing it with other eyes .
So stop searching for the right sport , this one is for you !
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport medium for environmental care .
In spite of some people making enough money to buy their own car , electric and hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones who use gas or diesel ) so , people choose these ones and that 's because pollution is a major issue that we have to deal with .
Environmental care is taking strength every day , from kids to ancient people .
The government and many companies are measuring the CO 2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for producing goods for social consumption .
If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when destiny is far from the place where you live .
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government will slow down the fee for public transportation . That could make people use public transportation and care for the environment from CO 2 emissions and prevent global heating .
In Coslada City Council , people are well informed about taking care of the environment .
The city council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of its citizens . For example , children learn at school how to separate waste .
There are many ecological islands .
Each of them has three or four kinds of bins and they are not as far as two hundred meters .
There have been several planting campaigns to plant trees and to clean the river Jarama side .
Nevertheless it is never enough , because dog owners have most of the blame .
Since 2008 , there are many bike paths across the city , so the citizens will be able to avoid the car and they will emit less air pollution .
The organic waste is picked up every day and plastic and paper waste is picked up every other day .
The most important thing in environmental care is the education of children .
Our planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take over the problem .
A problem which was caused by us , human beings , with their goal of making money without thinking of the effects .
My family is very conscious of this problem , so we make no effort to solve it .
We usually use public transport , which has a great quality in the city where I live .
It works perfectly : it is always on time and the price is worth it .
We live in a cottage and we have several bins which are classified according to the material we want to recycle .
Moreover , we run an organization which pays people who bring us the materials to recycle .
The benefits are given to several organizations which take care of the environment .
My sister teaches people what to do with things they want to get rid of , such as bottles or paper .
She is able to do such beautiful jewellery that lots of people are following her !
It shows that these kinds of things can have a second life .
As soon as the last river ends , the southern border of Egypt is here .
The Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counts over 6 thousand years .
All historians , researchers , scientists agree with this .
And as for me , I totally support their point of view .
Egypt is a kind of river civilization among the huge desert Sahara .
All over the time , the Nile is the only source of water for Egyptians .
Furthermore , elevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of fertile lands .
The Egyptians called their country ' Black Land ' to mark it off of the red soil of the desert .
Nowadays , the deep and wide valley of the Nile has become the most important transport line for Egypt .
Through the centuries people have been exploring the nature of the Nile .
The ancient Egyptians divided the year into three seasons compared to the dry or wet period .
They knew when it would be the ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nile ' to stock up with clean water .
But such a high level of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative side as well as positive .
A great number of dams were built on the river that caused the disappearance of a lot of plants and animals .
Anyway , a lot of Egyptians are still living far from the main water artery of the country and can hardly find clean water to drink .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt becomes developing , the government will pay attention to the ecological problems at a high level .
When most people think about an important historical place in Italy , they think of Duomo , in Milano .
But Duomo is not the most important .
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's the Colosseum .
For centuries this building has been the symbol of this city .
It is quite ancient , but still fascinating for thousands of tourists , who come every year .
It was built in 79 A. C. by Tito , who was the Roman emperor .
It was used for shows with animals or humans , who were killed without pity .
Moreover , navy wars were represented in order to celebrate the Roman army .
It has been ruined through the ages , but now people understand his importance and take care of it .
In my opinion , it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
However , not all people are aware of it .
It 's our strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people succeeded in building it .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .
In this fast - moving world , transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daily living .
There is no point in saying public transport has no future .
Travelling through the car is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .
There are advantages and disadvantages to using public transport .
Firstly , to discuss the benefits of public transport , it is cheap and affordable for all classes of people in society .
A variety of buses are released by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .
Using public transport is a waste of time and no privacy are some of the disadvantages .
Similarly , travelling by car has its own advantages and disadvantages .
Everybody can not afford to travel through a car as it is costly , but to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy during travel and is convenient and sophisticated and can travel faster .
To sum up , it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both have equal advantages and disadvantages .
Sometimes I think that Taipei is too crowded .
There is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient metropolitan system .
However , during the rush hour , there is always such a ruin person who has no public awareness at all .
They occupy too many seats , including priority seats .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't respect other passengers , just keep laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told them not to do this .
Moreover , I think that providing the seat to elderly people is also a problem .
Priority seats are preserved for those who need them , not only elderly people but also some adults need them .
Somehow , not all of them can you identify whether their bodies feel uncomfortable merely from their appearance , which leads to some misunderstanding between them .
Some people even blame them for occupying the seats instead of offering the seat .
Moreover , some old people would take this considerative action for granted and they would even command young adults or students to offer their seat without manners !
In my opinion , the transportation in our city has nothing to criticize except that .
Everyone should develop awareness of public manners .
Television is an important part of modern culture .
We depend on television for entertainment , education , news and films . TV has many benefits : Firstly , it enables young people to share cultural experiences with others .
TV can act as a catalyst to get kids reading - following up on TV programs by getting books on the same subjects or reading authors whose work was adapted for the programs .
Television can teach kids important values and life lessons .
Educational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills .
News , current events and historical programming can help make young people more aware of other cultures and people .
Documentaries can help develop critical thinking about society and the world .
TV can help introduce young people to classic Hollywood films and foreign movies that they might not otherwise see .
Cultural programming can open up the world of music and art for young people .
But television also has negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television get less exercise .
In addition , these children receive less socialization with other children .
Television also takes away from family time .
This is also true for families who eat in front of the television .
I deal with consulting and sales of financial products and services to an international bank , in the mass - market and small - business .
I follow the relationship with customers from acquisition to the advice until the realization of contracts , building and maintaining relationships after - sales in the aim of customer satisfaction . I also worked with large and small teams in back - offices , managed many administrative activities related to mortages , personal loans , contability and investments too .
I worked for several years to the acquisition of new customers , to provide them with a complete service , from the account to insurance products , investment products , personal loans , revolving credit , and cross - selling products .

I have faced several situations where I always work with serenity and enthusiasm . I like to work in a multicultural and dynamic environment .
I 'm careful to meet the goals of the team in which I work , cooperating with colleagues to achieve the goals by providing my skills , always willing to learn , respecting other points of view together finding ways to deal .
I have worked for the same large company for 25 years . Now is the time to change and find new job opportunities .
Needs to work . My husband has been living in Zaandam . I want to find a new job in Holland to rejoin our family .
I like sports such as skiing , riding and swimming .
I 've also got the rescue licence . I worked as a lifeguard in the summer studying for the patent padi dive master . Nowadays we all hope that public transport can save the world .
When we see all these cars in our yards , when we stay in traffic jams , we think that one day we will have to live in our car and use public transport .
If we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in an immortal traffic jam .
But , probably , this situation is only a period of development of transport .
We are told about a lot of innovations in this device .
For instance , Google reported about Googlemobile .
Maybe robots will be able to drive more smartly than people .
If they contact each other and use Googlemap or something like that , they will be able to avoid accidents on the roads .
So people will be able to avoid traffic jams .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Some people think it might take away their independence .
But other people think that it is not such a bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact that they are drivers at the moment .
However , there will always be people who dislike being a driver anyway .
And people who hate public transport , there will always be .
The question is , which sort of people have more impact in the world , and , finally , who will decide .
How many languages do you speak ?
Did you ever think of learning another foreign language ?
Or do you want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is miles more important to learn a foreign language than before .
There are a few reasons which show you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
First , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak the local language , it makes your trip easier and more comfortable .
Second , to find a good job opportunity , business exchange is increasing at an international level . If you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value to your profile and you can get a higher salary .
Third , through learning a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language , at the time you also get to know its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than yours . It enriches your knowledge .
Over these years , more and more miserable accidents have happened around the world .
From newspapers , magazines , even foreign media , we can easily figure out that our environment is changing severely .
Many scientists infer that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' greed .
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , but forget to protect and cherish the Earth at the same time .
High - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .
Various factories emit excessive carbon dioxide into the air .
All the examples above will enhance the temperature and make the Earth hotter and hotter .
The higher the temperature increases , the worst the living quality is .
If people around the world could n't put more emphasis on our living places , we would have a dark and hopeless future .
Due to climate change , the weather is so hot that people could even have a water shortage .
Losing enough water supply , people 's bodies will become weak and rough .
In this living situation , instead of laughter and happiness , there will be more fights , hatred and sadness .
Everyone lives in despair , but can not find the entrance to brightness .
The terrible consequences are caused by humans ' unsatisfied heart .
Friends , from now , let us be members to protect and take care of our Earth !
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
The undercovered work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people , the real danger is if you get discovered .
When people know that they were deceived , that they trust were broken , heads will roll .
You have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .
The passion for the cause is the key to survival .
It is just something that I had to do , not you , not her , me .
I did n't choose that . This job has chosen me .
Dear Sir or Madamme , I would like to apply for the position of beach lifeguard help which I saw advertised .
For the last two years I have joined the swimming group at the University .
I managed to succeed in many competitions in the country and abroad .
I believe I am a suitable candidate for this post , considering the swimming skills I have .
On the other hand I completed the first aid course , in the Red Cross .
The job would give me the opportunity to use all the experience I have gained and what is more
It would provide me with new knowledge .
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need further information .
I am available to attend an interview at your convenience .
I look forward to hearing from you . Yours faithfully , Sebastián Hernández
In our modern world , many people suffer from stress that springs from life conditions .
In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave this condition in the holidays .
Therefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to renew the soul and revive the spirit for people .
In the holidays , people can get away from daily problems and can also take more time with their friends and family .
In this respect , many people prefer to go to natural places with their families in order to forget about bad situations in their lives .
For example , walking in the seaside or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly about their experiences in life .
People can review their decisions in holidays more accurately and helpfully .
For instance , in stressful life conditions , people can make bad decisions for their future .
Besides , people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces .
The reason is that people must complete their tasks in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
It can be clearly seen that in the holidays people are getting closer and they remember their feelings .
For example , people meet their relatives that they have never seen for a long time .
At the same time , people have a chance to go to sacred places in order to renew their spirits and souls .
They can pray to God and it gives relief to people .
When people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects they can become more happy .
Because people need to leave the material world .
In the holidays , people have time to review their mistakes that lead to a stressful life .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .
Also , holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the soul because people have a chance to move away from modern life that is full of material subjects .
Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity is not a common habit in Spain .
However , the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of development .
On the one hand , there are many benefits to cycling .
Firstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it lowers CO 2 emissions .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
On the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase in danger on the roads .
Statistically , cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
Getting wet when it rains , having to make a lot of effort to cycle into a strong wind , freezing weather or having to keep drinking when hot weather .
In my opinion , cycling contributes to improving community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
For example , people taking cars do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
And this undesirable time might not be so short during holidays , due to a less frequent schedule .
Also , we can drive a car to any place where public transport perhaps is not able to be reached .
When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausted , especially for a long distance .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , the advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private cars .
As we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less car exhausts are emitted per person .
Recently , several studies have shown evidence that there is a strong relation between car exhausts and lung cancers .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from the suffering of diseases and saving life .
Second , public transport saves city spaces .
As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays our cities become larger and more crowded .
Correspondingly , the space for each person becomes more limited than before .
Provided that every citizen owns a car and uses it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parking space and everyone would spend more time congested .
Last but not the least , public transport allows people to do other things which are impossible when driving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to their surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .
For a passenger , however , travelling is a complete relaxation .
People can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just loot outside .
Though there are many advantages to public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
E. g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environmentally friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a suitable one .
Languages for the future Should we learn other languages ?
We live in a world where day to day changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome them .
I think there are many reasons to learn languages .
On the one hand , it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the world without the language barrier .
Also , in recent years , expressing yourself in English , French , German and Russian has become something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
Also , I consider that it tends to be hard and takes time away from doing any other things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitable in the future , but to achieve it , they will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning . Rua francisco xavier no 3 óbidos,25 - 4 - 2014 Dear Usa Summer Camps , I am writing in response to your advertisement for a job .
I had a part - time job as a baby - sitter and I take care of my 11-year - old brother very often .
I worked in an Easter camp too and I have already prepared a lot of activities , like " rappel " , paintball ...
That is for these reasons . I think I have the skills for the job .
I can be contacted for a meeting at the above address .
I hope you consider me for the job , Rodrigo . Today , I went to my Winnie 's home with Adriana in the afternoon .
We ate delicious food and played interesting games altogether .
We had a great time .
At 2 o ' clock in the afternoon , we arrived at Winnie 's home .
First , we listened to some songs , such as almost and big big world .
After thirty minutes , we had tea .
Winnie loves eating very much , so I can easily find a lot of food at her home .
We had mouth - watering strawberry cakes and juicy apple juice for tea and they were extremely yummy .
After having tea , we play hide - and - search altogether in Winnie 's garden .
Adriana and I hid behind a bench and Winnie looked for us .
Suddenly , Winnie fell over a little stone .
Adriana and I immediately came to her and held her up . '
Your knee is bleeding .
Are you okay'I asked .
I was shaking like a leaf and my heart was pounding since I was worried about Winnie .
I had butterflies in my stomach .
'
Yes , I am fine , ' Winnie replied .
I felt relieved then .
Then , Adriana found a plaster and put it on Winnie 's wound .
Winnie felt warm inside and smiled happily .
I felt glad today although Winnie hurt herself .
Why ?
It is because our friendship is more rugged .
What an unforgettable day !
In my opinion , the house in the future will be better .
House of the future will be big and bright .
Inside will be full of conveniences .
Big spaces will be divided into a few zones .
Relaxation 's , learning 's , kitchen 's zones and so on .
In the house of the future there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in every house .
Television will be cordless , as this way as the present Internet .
Every house will be flexible .
Thanks to that , it can expand or reduce .
Everything depends on the number of people .
Swimming is my favourite sport .
Why do I like swimming ?
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport . It is an individual sport , so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's efforts , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness . It is a sport that can be learnt at any age , but children can start to learn to swim as early as two years of age .
Swimming has different types ; dolphin , crawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful in weight reduction . If you are obese and need to reduce weight , it is also the best sport for asthmatic patients because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you will start to learn to swim , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your age .
Hello Paul , I enjoyed helping at the concert which was in Antaya in October .
I had a great time with people who are working as a helper for the concert .
I got a lot of experience from them .
In the concert time all people can enjoy it but nobody thinks about how they are preparing for the concert .
I saw so many interesting things during the preparation time .
For example , they know everything about each helper 's jobs , but at the same time , they just concern their own subjects .
I want to explain to you some interesting parts from my experience .
In the morning , we were excited and thinking about the concert and we decided not to think about the concert , just do your job which would be given .
When we were arranging the concert plan we made work sharing for all of us .
Some of them started designing the stage , some of them checking songs ' volume and lights .
My job was checking the songs list which singers would perform on .
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of the singers .
They always wanted to change some songs which were on the list .
At the concert time I was really worried that something would appear suddenly .
Actually everybody can be worried because they gave time and effort to it .
Finally the concert started and all the lights were shining like stars .
It is difficult to explain that feeling .
When the concert finished I felt like a bird which was flying freely .
Of course I had some pain in my legs because all the time I was standing .
However , I like to be a volunteer on enjoyable projects .
I want to invite you to our next concert which will be next month . If you have any time please come and see how we are preparing for the concert .
I am waiting for your email .
See you !
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most affected .
Regarding advertising , technology is having a huge , and not always positive impact on outdoor advertising .
From black - and - white adds posted in public places we have moved to practically live surrounded by outdoor adds placed in every available and imaginable spot .
From buildings with enormous and bright screens to interactive bus stop signs .
The recent developments in mobile technology allow advertisers to offer personalized publicity to each of us .
I 'm sure that in the very near future , if I have been looking for restaurants in Mallorca on my computer or mobile at home , on my way to work the adds on the buses I will see - which of course will be screens and not printed paper - will show images of Mallorca , or an add from Tripadvisor with Mallorca in it .
It will suit me sometimes , and it will even be useful , but I 'm also sure sometimes I will find it aggressive .
The way it feels aggressive to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright screens , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are .
Advertisements might be considered an art , or at least some pieces are really artistic , but placed on the wrong spot or shown at the wrong time they lose their artistic side .
But , technology is here for the best or worst , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
If I could change one thing in my life , I would like to change my house .
I 'd like to have a big detached house in the suburbs of Artem or Vladivostok .
So that I could live more freely and independently .
If I had this house , I would decorate it in a modern room .
I would build a fitness gym , wardrobe - room , swimming pool .
If I had such a house , I would like to equip a barbecue area in my garden .
I could invite my friends and relatives .
Together we could spend time in a pleasant atmosphere .
When it comes to my favorite sport , tennis will always be my answer .
Though I am a beginner at it , I think it 's interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which sounds very challenging .
When I feel stressed off , I always play tennis to release my pressure .
If you are a beginner at tennis , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for you first .
As the proverb goes :
If you want to learn something well , you will need to get the right tools first to work on it .
Next , you are required to learn every basic skill step by step .
Since tennis requires lots of basic skills , if you do n't learn these important techniques slowly and steadily , you may get hurt during the practice .
Finally , finding a good teacher is also critical .
A skilled coach can teach you the best skills in tennis .
Do we have better television than a few decades ago ?
Do we have enough choices on the screen ?
Can you imagine having only two channels and not playing the whole day ?
That was only 30 years ago .
An explosion of channels arrived at our houses in the eighties .
In this report we will see some characteristics of today 's television .
The number of Channels is gradually decreasing .
In our country one decade ago when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All TV tried to get several licences to distribute their shows .
In order to resolve some deficits in budgets , today there are mainly two TV groups .
Less channels means less choices .
Internet TV is increasing
It costs less money and you can choose exactly the moment , where and with who is watching this or that television program .
You just follow a suggestion made by someone .
You just click on it .
They have to reduce their budget . Despite changing channels , we see the same news .
Big broadcast groups are used by all of them .
It is expensive to keep journalists and cameras all around the world .
It is cheaper to buy it .
Summary : TV is dying .
It is hard to compete with the Internet .
Nowadays only national or international broadcast groups can be in the match .
Perhaps political reasons help to maintain such a budget deficit .
However , the fact is that there is a countdown on them .
Dear Mrs Hopkins , I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest in joining your small group on a trip around the world .
I am a 20- year - old student from Switzerland speaking German , French and English and I am keen on travelling .
With several trips to many countries I have made until now , I would say that I already have some experience of travelling around the world .
I am interested in joining your group , because I like meeting new people from other countries and I would like to explore new countries around the world .
For ten years I have been in a scout group in which I have learnt a lot about different kinds to find a way or to orientate myself in the wilderness .
Furthermore , I feel suitable to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your adventure .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Dear Steve ,
It was good to hear from you .
Basically my idea is to use this trip to learn as much as possible . I mean , not only the English language but also to know more about your culture and visit nice places in your country as well .
As I told you before , I ca n't afford to pay for this trip alone , so my father will put up some money to help me .
But I wanna find a job to help him with the bills .
Can you give me a hand on it ?
You can also help me to find a cheap place to rent .
It will be helpful if you find a small apartment near Cambridge University where I 'll study English for 5 months .
Thanks for all your help and I look forward to hearing from you .
Best wishes Jo   o Matos Hi John , I am looking forward to seeing you .
First of all , you should get outside of the airport terminal .
There you will see bus stations in the street .
When you get there , take the bus , which has number 111 .
Then ride to the bus stop " Zlin " .
There you can get to the underground station and travel to the centre of Prague .
If you choose this way , I 'll call you in the morning to tell you where we will meet exactly .
But if I were you , I would take a taxi because the underground is quite boring , but it is cheaper .
Anyway , you need to get to the centre .
I 'll wait for you there .
Finally , the weather forecast for next month looks pleasantly as it is usual at this time of year .
That 's why you do n't have to take warm clothes .
I am delighted to see you soon .
Best wishes , Jacob
In my opinion , we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment to do work better than before .
Firstly , we can discuss the type of food we want to eat .
Actually , students eat a lot of fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do food . For these reasons , I think that the best restaurant is somewhere when they do home - made food , and a good idea is for the main course : baked potatoes , steamed vegetables and for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture . Maybe we should choose a special restaurant . I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a white chair , table and wall , more or less a relaxing environment , but the atmosphere is very important for dinner and I think that we must vote for this , because we will have a good night or not depending on the type of atmosphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because normally we have spoken about books , work and studies , while with this type of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know something new about other mates .
I would like to go to Foster 's Hollywood .
I love the food here and I think my classmates too .
You can make it the best burgers you have ever eaten .
They are incredibilly delicious .
I do not know how they make and cook them .
These burgers are my favourite food because they are amazing .
I can not say how they are because you have to taste them .
It is a flavour similar to staying in heaven or in paradise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile on your face .
You will want to come another time .
However , if you do not like burgers , you can eat whatever you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opinion as a person who has eaten another meal .
Public transport plays an important role in our modern day lives .
More than a billion people use buses , taxis and trains etc as tourists , for work , meeting relatives , going to school etc .
Many even use cars .
Though travelling by car is more convenient , it is expensive .
That is why the cost of petrol , diesel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world .
While travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in the following ways :1 .
People can save the money they spend on petrol .
2 .
As they have specific routes across the country , town , city and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc .
I disagree with the statement stated above because in future we are likely to have only two classes in society ; the rich and the poor .
Middle class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
It is because of high taxes on goods .
So , I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone age .
Public transport is even better for our environment than cars .
Nowadays people have different views about reading books and watching movies .
Some of them think that books are more interesting than their film versions .
I agree with this point of view .
I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .
Firstly , reading helps to become a well - educated person and gives a chance to develop knowledge .
That 's why while you are reading you are getting a piece of information .
Furthermore , books develop the imagination of readers .
When you are reading a picture of what is happening appears in your mind .
You can imagine what heroes look like , you can imagine different views , where the action takes place .
And finally , I think it 's very important that you can easily take your book with you and start reading anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you like being in company , the best way for you is movies .
Because you can watch it with your friends .
Also many people choose movies because they like soundtracks and special effects .
It 's so exciting , but all these factors are not important for me .
I suppose that books are better than the film version .
To sum up , I 'd like to say reading is a really great thing .
A girl was walking home one day .
She was with her mum .
She was just a young beautiful girl !
So , they were going home when the girl noticed a cute doll in a shop .
She had blond hair and she was wearing a blue dress , white gloves and black shoes .
Just like her ... ' Mum I love this doll !
Could you bye it for me ? " she said .
Her mum could n't deny it to her , so she bought it .
Oh
The girl had so many special moments with her doll ! !
They looked so adorable together !
They were like twins !
After some years , the girl decided that she had to move .
She was eighteen years old , she had to be independent .
So she took a deep breath and put her doll in the attic just like in her childhood memories .
At night she heard some creepy noises from there ...
She went there and there was the doll with a knife in her hand . " Bell , why do n't you play with me anymore ?
Are you bored with me ?
Just because I have only one eye ?
But you removed me from the other one .
Just because I do n't have one for my gloves ?
But you did it again ! " she screamed .
And then ...
Next day , going to her home her mum wanted to find her daughter .
So , she went upstairs ...
The girl had a knife in her kneck and on the wall there was a sentence , " Why did you leave me that way ? " Tennis is an individual sport .
You just have to deal with the game .
You can choose lots of places to play .
You need a good pair of shoes , a tennis racket and some balls and a person who you play with .
Although you should be good at playing backhand or forehand , you can lose finally .
This sport is not just about physical power .
You are supposed to use your brain as well .
It is a combination of physical power , a technique and mental power .
Like the other sports , tennis is getting more modern , fast and commercial .
I mean professional tennis .
Some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory .
Some of them practise tennis because of their parents .
It is not fair enough .
Children should play games , not just tennis , because it is fun , it develops their skills , helps to maintain their physical health and so on .
You can start if you are grown up anyway .
It is never too late .
Either you can find a professional coach or just join your friends .
Enjoy ! Dear Mrs Kate Ashby , My name is Andrea Cocci . I 'm sixteen , and I saw the advertisement for the weekend work in your cafe , and I 'm interested in working with you .
I ' m the perfect choice for this work . In fact , I 'm interested in different kinds of food because I am Italian , and for us food is everything .
In Italy , I attend school for waiters and cook , and sometimes I cook lasagna , pasta , pizza and many other specialties of my country , and I was assumed to be in many famous restaurants .
I 'm also good at dealing with people . In fact , since when I was younger , I have been the animator at the summer camp of Alpignano , the city where I lived , and I have spent a lot of time with children and adults .
I also worked for many theater companies and I am so good and kind when I talk with other people , also if I do n't know them .
In the end , I was also prepared to work long hours . When I worked with my aunt in his cafe , I worked from eight a.m. and I lasted at 9 p. m. , it was difficult but I did it all day .
I look forward to hearing from you soon , Andrea Cocci Essay
In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and cons of studying English abroad .
Is it really worth leaving your own country for a period of time to study English ?
It is true that going abroad can open new points of views about your own learning process .
Talking with English native speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to judge how well or badly you are doing .
Besides , it can be fun and enjoyable if you plan it properly .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money on it and you will not be assured to achieve your goals at all , so it will be able to become a real nightmare if you do not focus on your learning tasks .
From my point of view , I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages , especially if you have some money saved for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution , which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
You can even talk with native speakers by using some Chat Rooms online such as Skipe and others .
Football , a passion
When I was little , I tried a lot of sports ; Handball , Swimming , Tennis , but my favourite sport is not one of those , it is a sport that I have never imagined : Football .
All my life I thought that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls , but once I tried it , I loved it .
Have you ever thought about playing football ?
At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , who were all boys , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable . However , some years ago , they started to intergrate me when they played , and nowadays , I love playing football with them .
Now , some women and I have started to organize female matches , so I am more used to playing with girls .
I never imagined that I was going to be so keen on football , but now it is part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sport , and everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or her life .
One thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to receive some punches .
I recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping centre .
I have been there twice , and I like it .
Its name is " The English oven " , and it 's a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with British food .
The service is excellent and the waiters are so pleasant and gentle .
The interior is big , so all the class could stay inside without problems .
The decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's got some great traditional British objects .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
They 've got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
They have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .
The desserts are very good too .
They 've got original ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional .
There is a big variety of ice creams .
This restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopping centre , so we can get there by bus or by train .
I think this is the best restaurant to go to at the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually go there .
During whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , and the media accompany them .
In my view , public people deserve to have their own life , without photographing .
On the one hand , becoming a public person compared with journalists , mass - media , flashes .
Famous people are obligated to provide their life in an exemplary way .
However , they are still ordinary people , they make mistakes .
People are thought to be jealous .
Notice any kind of failures .
It seems to me that journalists might be absolutely toxic and they have defective influence on society which assesses celebrities through the prism of journalistic documentary .
On the other hand , many stars sell their privacy to earn more and more money .
The value of their talent and abilities is counted in the amonut of tabloid scandals .
Summing up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring into limelight their lives .
It has always been very useful for a long time ago . Nevertheless , nowadays , there are some people who ask if public transport was suppressed , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
Firstly , the main reason is the cost because people who do not have a car need to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .
The cars need to be repaired ; besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .
In addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is global warming because the atmosphere is very polluted .
If you use public transport , you can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together on only one transport .
Finally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .
Besides , in some cities , cars can not be parked in some places , such as : the old city and the city centre .
Summing up , people are aware of global warming and think about the high cost of having a car .
From my point of view , I get used to walking around my city and my car is just used if I travel around the country .
We are living in an ever changing world .
Today 's new things become things of the past in a few months .
Take an example of mobile technology . Your latest handset , with the latest configurations , becomes outdated within a few months after buying it .
50 years is a very long time and people 's lives will definitely change in such a long period .
However , the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive change or a negative one .
For the last 50 years science and technology took great leaps . The internet , mobiles have made us more connected .
Today , we have all the information on finger - tips .
Today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost in a new place . Google maps are always there to help .
We do n't need to cram English words today , as we can quickly find the meaning of any word on our mobiles .
Meeting new people or selling your products , you do n't need to face anyone , everything can be managed through virtual platforms .
Today our lives have become much more comfortable than in the past . Thanks to progress mankind has made in technology .
On the other hand , the number of terrorism , global warming and greed became the top challenges of today 's world .
Climate change due to global warming causing natural disasters now and then .
Terrorist activities causing havoc in public life .
Corruption and greed of people in power make it difficult to trust people 's leaders .
If these challenges are not addressed in the coming years , imagining better lives for people in 50 years hence is rather difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a tool . On the right , it would be a boon for us . On the wrong hand , it has the power to destroy the world as we see it today . To those who are concerned , I 'm an Italian girl who 's studying to improve her English .
I 've got a positive and energetic personality .
I read your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought "
That 's for me , I 'm the right person for this kind of job ! " .
Perhaps you 're wondering why I should be the right person .
That 's soon said .
I ' ma motivated , flexible and open - minded person and I have a lot of experience in this field as well .
I 've worked as a social trainer and as an educator since I was 16 .
I love doing social activities and planning events .
When I worked as an educator , I used to plan and manage some sports and outdoor activities .
I had very great memories of these experiences and I would really like to live them again .
If you are interested , please have a look at my CV .
As you requested , I attach it to this mail .
Best regards .
Personally , mobile phones are very important in my life .
I need that device near me because I have three children and I want to know how and where they are .
The same about my parents ; they are old and sometimes they call me to talk about their health .
Concerning video - games , I agree with the theory that they thought it would help children 's brains to develop , but it is important to control them because there are a lot of violent games .
However , there are brilliant games for children .
In my opinion , the Internet is absolutely a revolution in current society .
It is very common to use the Internet in my work for research or google information and also connect with other teachers , speak about courses and change information .
Finally , I think technological developments make us improve in the future .
Friends should always be like a shadow beside you .
In the time of joy and sorrow .
Nothing is impossible in life but I do not doubt it is not easy to find sincere friends .
It does not mean you will never find one .
It is very important to interact and socialise with people to make friends .
The more people you meet , the easier it will become for you to find a friend .
When you find one , spend time with them , share views , ideas and go out with them .
Friends do not have to agree on everything you say but they should share their views about it .
The Guardian is a British daily newspaper which includes national and international news .
You can find a variety of articles such as politics , Business and Money , sports , culture , education , Life and style , Travels , the weather and the environment . There are plenty of advertisements for jobs and donations to help individuals . Readers are able to express their opinion freely . They use a quality English language which avoids slang language .
As a result , it is suitable for students who learn English to improve their English .
On the other hand , I realised there were two disadvantages .
For example , it is not suitable for children due to official language . There were also a huge number of commercial advertisements which make the readers bored .
Overall ,
The Guardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nowadays , in the modern and progressive world where people are smart and the economy is very highly developed .
Some people think that we need tablet computers instead of books .
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes when I am watching TV or I am reading a newspaper I notice that gadgets have become very useful for our life .
It seems to me good opportunities to make our life more easy .
Also it makes us more clever .
I am convinced that using tablet computers in our everyday life is rather good .
People do not need to carry a lot of books in a bag .
Pupil could not say that he left a book because he had all the books on his tablet computers .
Some people think that it is a bad idea .
They believe that it is a useless thing for our generation .
Such people are sure that electronic things make us stupid .
They insist on not using tablets at school .
Personally , for me , I like books very much . When I am at home I use books because I like to smell and to touch the paper of books .
I do not agree with the people who think that tablets are useless .
We should use it but we must not forget about books .
In conclusion , I want to say that we should keep abreast of new technologies and try to make our lives easier The Big Mistake
This day was full of joy and happiness , but something went wrong after when she told him that she was pregnant .
She was so happy about this news and she thought that he would be happy as well , but ...
At the moment when she told him that she was pregnant , he just frozen .
It was too much for him .
He thought it 'd be easier to walk away and avoid this conversation with her .
He tried to understand what was going on with him .
It was weird how many questions and doubts came up on his head .
One part of him was really happy , because being a father is one of his biggest dreams , but on the other hand he could n't handle this news .
This woman , who stands next to him , is his girlfriend , his future wife .
He should be happy and hug her and celebrate this good news .
But somehow he did n't feel anything .
All that he felt was anxiety .
He could n't handle the feeling when she tried to touch him , to kiss and hug him .
He knew that she loved him as much as he loved her , but everything was just too wrong at that moment .
Her voice , her smile and even her body were wrong at that moment .
She could n't understand what was going on , because it was just three weeks ago that they had a conversation about kids and family and he said that he would like to have kids with her .
And now , he just avoids her and he is not happy about the news .
It was a big mess .
She was more than happy and he could n't handle this news .
They both knew that they loved each other and they cared about each other , but it was too much for him .
He stood up and said to his girlfriend that he needed a break and he had to be alone .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To start with , I am going to talk about what my lovely sports are and why I will enjoy the sport .
In fact , I do not like to do some sports during the time , but if I really need to do some exercises , I like to go swimming in the swimming pool .
Firstly , I think the swimming pool is clearing .
Such as after swimming that I have a safe and a bathroom to take a shower .
Secondly , I do not like to go to the beach . This is because I do not like big sun and sand .
Third , swimming in the ocean is most dangerous .
However , I like to stay in the swimming pool during the summer .
Actually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
Moreover , I think before any kind of sport that we should do some exercises , that is because we need to relax our bodies first .
If we do not do it , we will get dangerous while we are doing any sports .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we can not stay at home or work all the time .
Even if you really do not like to do exercise , you can go shopping .
The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pasture area where local farmers have been breeding sheep , cows and pigs for centuries in spite of the hard weather conditions such as high temperatures and terrible drought in summer .
As a result , our water resources are difficult to preserve and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of rational use of them .
The local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend their free time or even do sports .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste systems with the active cooperation of most citizens who are really concerned about the recycling of waste needs .
In fact , around 90 % of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish , taking it out to the yellow , green and blue containers in every street .
And that is the negative point . These dumpsters are too visible in town and it would be advisable to change the ones we have for underground ones .
I woke up today and I just remember that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones that do it will reward a bonus point , but anyways this is n't important information .
I searched for my family in the house and there was no one in the home , just me .
I get a bit scared so I search for them outside in the streets .
I did n't know that a bomb hit the city and killed almost everyone . Now I have to find my parents .
I think the reason why I did n't know about the explosion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it 's not that beautiful so you ca n't distinguish were the explosion hit .
Finally in some days I found some neighbors with some food . I was starving to death so I ate a lot .
We made some incentives about laws , but it was a total conflict , because the group noticed that some food was missing somehow .
I think that someone drags some of the food on the night while everybody is sleeping .
So everybody is going to try to enforce the laws .
The next morning I ate a piece of steak and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around to kill and eat us .
In the night I was thinking about many things just when I heard some noises .
I stalked him and it seemed that this guy had a hump .
I stomp on him and when he turned around it was a woman from the group .
We were talking about this when a dog just came near ; it was adorable just when he converted into a big weird creature .
He bit my leg and it hurt a lot . We tried to alert the others but it was too late . It was the group or us .
We saw that beast eating our friends and the food .
In some ways , she robbed the food in the night and I wake up . It was good for my survival .
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how I am going I would not do it because I have to face all of this .
DOING EXCERCISE IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH
Why do you have to exercise ?
What benefits do you obtain while exercising ?
Do you know that 75 % of people in Mexico do n't do any type of exercise ? This is a big problem for our society and is the problem number 1 of why Mexico is the country with the most obese in the world .
Doing exercise is an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life . While you exercise , you feel well with yourself and your body .
There 's a lot of benefits that come in hand with doing exercise like reducing or taking control of your weight . It helps you with heart disease , problems with your body , and also you can make a lot of friends while doing any exercise .
Nowadays there 're a lot of different types of exercising . You can do any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the GYM or do Crossfit or something like that .
Soccer is a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay fit , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to control the ball and dribble you 're rivals on the field .
I recommend you to practise any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .
Thanks and start now , you wo n't regret it .
Is there any future for public transport , because travelling by car is much more convenient ?
Many disagree about public transport , who are to be disappearing , though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in travelling .
This composition will explain the two different opinions .
Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Also , unlike public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more comfort and speed .
There is a perception that a car can give you freedom of choice .
On the website of The Scottish Government ( publication " Young people and transport ") , a 12 - 14-year - old boy explained « - I prefer going in the car , it 's quicker ...
There 're not as many people around you ...
I prefer the car because you can listen to music as well . » Although there are many positive points about private cars , they are also negative ones .
Indeed , cars increase pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . «On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .
Then just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .
Obviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh . » says a 17 - 22-year - old boy .
Now , secondly , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay any fees on public transport , but also , it is safer . According to The Saigon Times , there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred in private cars .
The main reason is that the cars ' owners are drunk when driving .
It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drunk , it would not have as many accidents .
Finally , many developed countries in the world , such as England , America , Canada , Japan and so on , have built a public transport system , so traffic jams have been decreased .
As a result , the economy has been increasing .
From this analysis , it isobvious that travelling by public transport is very important .
Topic :
Do you agree or disagree that " Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement about always telling the truth to be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .
Even though being truthful is crucial in relationships , always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unwise .
Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matters and it would feel awkward to mention to colleagues or the employer .
It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment .
To further illustrate the first point above , it could hurt one 's feelings by telling the truth all the time .
For example , if some woman you are acquainted with wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion .
People usually tend not to tell her the truth , since it could make her feelings .
Instead of doing so , people may praise her for other things .
In that case , they could still make conversions without boiling her mood .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private , since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk to people at work or even people that have just got acquainted .
If there are questions about things one does not want other people to know , they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much .
If I had a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people to ask for details about it by saying that I just had some errands to run .
These are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or not .
Last Friday , Michael and I were in school playing happily with each other in the classroom .
When we were in the class , suddenly Michael walked towards the door .
Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he made a mistake .
Due to this , we 're both called to meet the headmaster .
I could n't understand why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door .
The door was n't broken into pieces or fell down .
My curiosity had put me into big trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he could give me the answer I wanted .
However , things did n't happen like what I hoped .
I ended up getting expelled from school because the teacher and the classmates suspected Michael and I stole our classmate - Sally 's wallet .
I could n't imagine the teacher and friends also pointed at us firmly and without giving us any chance to speak out .
I finally realised that everything was a trap and we 're the unlucky and innocent ones as we fell into the trap .
We wiped off our tears , and waved our hands when we left school .
However , one day later the headmaster found out the truth through CCTV , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change to a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
This is because the teacher has a biased mindset .
Dear USA summer camps , my name is Bianca Padovesi , and I have read your advertisement for the job .
I consider I am the right person for this job because , firstly , I speak fluent and clear English , which is very important to communicate .
Also , I have a good relationship with little kids . I usually look after my nieces and nephews over the weekends and they love spending time with me . Moreover , I am very energetic , always awake and ready to work hard .
Furthermore , I am very creative and it is a good aspect of myself , as I can invent new and entertaining games for the kids to have a great time .
I like making puzzles or games which imply running , jumping , which are important for the kids ' development .
I am not very good at cooking but because I never have time to dedicate time to that .
I think that if I watched and learnt how to do it I would learn very fast and can dominate it .
That is a good quality of mine . I learn things very fast and I can also get used to new things .
I am very excited about this job and I hope you reply soon .
Bianca Day number 8 .
We were ready to go and find the others . We went outside the shelter we built and wrote a wall near to the shelter " safe zone " and if there is someone that needs supplies he would find some supplies and ammo to survive .
We started our journey and went in the forest . There were a lot of # pests on our way there were various guys that were sick . We could n't do anything except for , keep going . I was seeing my little group # decrease and some of us were # allergenic to some plants . I was the only one that had no problem with all the other stuff people had problems with .
I thought that maybe my # genes were actually immune to the infection . I could actually be the # revolutionary guy that helped everyone that was in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it , but # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself . I have to think about whether it helps the entire world or just save a group . The decision was in my hands . It was # conventional to help the entire world but I do n't want to die .
While I was thinking about finding a body , it was a familiar body from someone that was in the group . One of those guys we wanted to find and live , not dead . His face was all rotten and eaten away by the walkers .
We needed to find the ones that were still alive or at least tell us what happened to everyone . The # battle against hunger started . Everyone was hungry and we had n't eaten anything in a few days and that could lead us to two things dead or eaten away by a walker so we needed to find something that was a # nutrition - based food where we could eat with no problem and be OK .
We found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could get a rest and take a shower to clean ourselves .
We got close to the pharmacy . There were no walkers inside so we ran into the pharmacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to check us in the night . I needed some rest and went to sleep immediately .
In my area there are many railway lines and they 're often overcrowded .
But private traffic in this town is yet more present . As a result , Turin is the town of FIAT , a well - known factory .
Near to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily buy all that you need to live .
When you have to pay the telephone and energy bills , you can do that in any tobacco shops near to your home .
If you like shopping , in the perimeter of the town , there are some big supermarkets , which hold many items from the main great factories in Europe and above .
Like all the industrialised countries , a connection to the Internet is granted almost for each area and each building .
In the end , the taxis are present and they cover all the town , but this service is less organised and developed than the English one .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in the music industry , deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .
To my mind , there should be a board between paparazzi work and the privacy of famous people .
In my opinion , big stars should be able to relax and take some private time .
As far as I 'm concerned , there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillance of people who wait to take pictures , which shows them in embarrassing situations .
Unfortunately , this is a part of celebrities ' work ' so they have to take into account .
But on the other hand , there should be some inviolable spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .
This rarely fragments of life without the eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .
I know that catching celebrities doing celaning or taking a dog for a walk is shocking news for people who read tabloids .
To my mind , they do not believe celebrities are such normal people as everyone of us only with more money in their bank accounts .
So , as you can see , I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a private life and the ability to have a normal life should also be given to them .
The Maze Runner I recently watched this new film based on one of the books of this worldwide known author .
As I have an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try .
The poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mystery , which made me take the decision to watch this film .
The film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , who is a 16- year - old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what seems to be a camp .
He has no idea how he ended up there .
However , he soon realizes that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze .
The people who live in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the menaces of the maze .
He took the role of a runner , the people responsible for exploring the maze and looking for an exit of this place .
Still , they only have the daylight time to explore the maze , as when the sun goes down it becomes very dangerous .
The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having its exciting moments when the characters discover something that is hidden inside the maze .
I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent .
I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more . What I love about it is first of all that tall or small . Anyone can play it as long as they 're determined , so basically it is a lifelong sport for everyone .
I love the speed of volleyball . Most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you probably miss something . Each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player directs the location of the ball in that amount of time and then there 's the intensity , if you have n't seen a game go until 32 - 30 , and see the energy on the floor and hear the noise from the crowd you 're missing out .
Personally winning such a set makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .
I am always trying to jump higher , hit harder , pass and set better , and serve in more different ways .
I live in New Eltham .
My area is very clean and very green .
People there are very friendly and helpful .
It is a good place to live .
One time per week on Wednesday , robbers are taken .
Of course , garbage is sorted into different bins .
That is a very good idea , because that robber undergoes recycling .
All my neighbors in the same way collected garbage .
Everybody cares about cleanliness in front of the house and in the garden .
In particular spring has a lot of colours and pleasant odors .
New Eltham has beautiful parks where you can relax from the busy place .
Green time in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently eaten at Black Bear restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a little town near Catania located under the Etna volcano slopes , and I found that restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
There were two rooms , a smoking room or a non - smoking room .
The surroundings were rustic , yet it still felt airy and cosy . The waiters were very friendly and informative .
As I was eaten with my friend Moreno and his father , I managed to sample a good range of items on the menu and I really liked the Chianina beef . It was very tasty .
All the ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality .
The price was n't reasonable at all , because the meal came at about forty euros per person , so this restaurant is a little expensive .
But I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the meal was a little expensive and I will no doubt be back for other dinners .
Drugs is a topic with a lot of controversy .
They have been present in our societies for ever .
Cannabis , heroin , speed are some examples of substances that are really well - known to all of us .
Legalization of drugs is a very used argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problem of the exclusion .
Margination has a link with the illegality of this activity .
Also , this illegality is the guilt for the attraction of drugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they are young and its prohibition is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when this entertainment becomes an addiction that can destroy our lives .
I think everyone has proved some kind of illegal drug to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
But we have to be responsible and be very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are not able to put deadlines on themselves .
Finally , legalization of drugs means that they could be taxable and we know how the taxes work in our country , so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .

Dear Les , Firstly , Spain is a great place for holidays in summer .
At that time , it was always sunny and , depending on the region , it could rain .
If you want to see some beautiful scenery , you must go to Barcelona , where you will be able to see La Sagrada Familia , which was built by Antoni Gaudi , or La Alambra in Granada , which is one of the Seven Wonders of the World .
In Madrid you can go to visit some museums , like Reina Sofa or El Prado .
On the other hand , if you want to see some wildlife , you must visit Cabarcenos National Park in Cantabria , which is like a little safari , or Doana National Park , which in that period you can see some migration birds .
If I were you and I had a completely summer to enjoy Spain , I would stay one week in each place , and I rent a car in order to move between the cities .
I recommend you not to take warm clothes .
I hope you enjoy your summer .

Bart Simpson is my favourite fictional character on TV .
He is the eldest son of the Simpson family .
Bart is ten years old and is a typical American child .
He has yellow skin and big eyes , he is blond and has gotspiky hair .
Bart always wears a red T - shirt and blue shorts .
The most important thing for Bart is to be the most popular student in his school . For this reason , he is always misbehaving .
His parents and the school principal often punish him .
Bart is an energetic and clever student but he is also a bad student and he hates nerds .
Although he is rather naughty , he actually has a heart of gold because he helps his sister when she needs him .
In the Simpson family , all the characters are very funny .
A lot of magazines say The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history and I absolutely agree .
For me , Bart is more fun than Homer , although most magazines say that Homer is the best character .
It was a very rainy Sunday morning .
I was n't in the mood to go out anyway .
Everything suggested that I would n't get out of the house for quite a while .
Suddenly , there was a heavy knock on the door .
Who on Earth could that be ?
Who would have even bothered to pay me a visit during this bloody awful weather ?
My concerns were answered swiftly , because the man on my threshold yelled : " I have a letter for Mr. Samson ! " I was quite surprised . To be honest , I had n't received a letter for months .
I opened it and quickly scanned the text .
At first , I had observed the letter cautiously , but then I noticed my uncle 's name in it .
Although I had n't met him a single time , this letter was his last will and I learned that I inherited a good deal of money .
Fifty thousand pounds , to be precise .
Exultation seized my mind instantly , but I soon began to worry : "
What will I do with this amount of money ? "
Well , the task I have chosen is about the town where I have been staying for the last ten years .
Actually , this town is located in the middle of hills and a river without water .
I am very worried about the town where I am staying because everybody in this town does not bother about rubbish things they do every day .
First of all , they are very dirty by nature . They are very casual with the environment and the importance of cleanliness .
So - called people of good nature are inactive and talkative and gossip about others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
All the household near the public road throws dirty things easily and even does n't bother about the order of the municipality .
I see all these during my morning walk . What I feel is that everyone who is staying in the town should at least keep their own front places and sides around them .
I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow people and look for their feedback , but they are also the same in nature .
People are now self - centred and very narrow - minded .
Though they are becoming so - called educated , in real sense they are still savage .
