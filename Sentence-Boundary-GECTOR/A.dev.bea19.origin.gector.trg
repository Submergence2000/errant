It 's difficult to answer the question " what are you going to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car , but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , a car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street . At that moment , you realize the importance of public transport .
In India we have various types of public transport , like cycles , bikes , cars , trains & flights .
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by national highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We have stopped at hotels to have food and , just in case if any of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since , we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & flight ) .
In addition to that , we can also take a comfortable short nap in the back seat and wake up fresh .
For For the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to joining you in this year 's summer camps .
I love children , and I enjoy looking after them . Also , I organized many sports activities before in my school .
In addition to that , I enjoy cooking .
My family thinks that my cooking is amazing .
I hope that you give me the chance to join you .
Thanks
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love to play with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere . When I travel on the beach I like playing with my sister in the sand and after that we go to the sea .
It is very funny .
When I was young , I liked play with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you about some advice on travelling and working in my country .
On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of places to travel .
For example , Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit . For example , in Madrid you can visit " Puerta del Sol " , " Las Cibeles " .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
Every summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are a few jobs because the economy is very bad .
But , if you want , I will look for a job from you .
My best friend is looking for a person responsible for looking after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after her every weekend .
Are you interested in this job ?
Thank you for your e - mail . It was wonderful to hear from you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Laura .
Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and it will keep on in the future .
Because public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in a mass transport system .
Also , people do need to suffer high operating costs running their own car .
But it can be a cheaper way of going to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane to travel to another country .
Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane .
I think that public transport in the future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that do n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport will continue to have a future , but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground .
If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them while we wait for the bus or underground , but on the other hand , the car costs more money than public transport .
By car , we can just stay by ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unknown . But if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so both transport are good and the cars do n't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport .
If I had to choose between both transportations I think I would probably choose the car because it is better for me to go by car then to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological things .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the last garden , with worms who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building we have special trashcans to separate the garbage into organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles and they also make talks and presentations about the earth 's problems like global warming , pollution , etc .
The manager of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All these initiatives have made us all over the years a recognised ecological community .
Good morning everyone . Today I want to share my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football . Why did I choose it ? Football is an international sport . People around the world will love it so much , like Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup and so on .
I believe that 's all that will delight us .
By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United . They are brilliant , they have amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream that was : be a super hero !
After many years , he still dreams of becoming a super hero .
He entered the university of medicine because he thought that this profession was more similar to being a super hero .
After some years at university and he knows a girl called Kate and he gets loved here and she gets loved by him .
Kate was cursing the University of Fashion .
Then the two started to date .
Michael and Kate were so happy , until one day Michael said to him he dreamt of being a super hero . Kate got so nervous , saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid 's dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super hero do n't exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and get mad , saying that she was lying and did n't have heart .
He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .
On the following day , she said sorry and they were happy again .
But when they get home , they fight again and Michael gets a knife and kills her .
He cried with a lot of blood around him .
Michael ran away from there .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history . It brings many benefits to our lives .
For instance , we take the subway in order to avoid stocking in traffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than taking public transportation . However , it would cause more damage to our life and harm our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our offspring .
Giving them a safe , clean and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jams will be more serious than before .
In my country , Taipei , we always stock in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can not imagine if there is no bus or MRT , how long I will take for school .
A car is convenient for humans , but it causes damage to humans also .
For example , carbon dioxide which is created by cars .
It causes global warming , which threats our environment and harms our daily life .
We can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather disasters happened in decades , such as typhoons , hurricanes , wild fire and mud slides .
What other precautions are usually taken ?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film was shipped .
If the film does n't arrive on time , it immediately .
Lost shipments can be found more easily when this process starts right away
The pleasure of traveling
People go , people come .
Every day lots of people are travelling abroad , but , what 's the best way to do an international trip ?
The most important option for travel is , by far , the plane .
But , even when it 's true that it 's the faster option , you must be very careful at the time you get off a plane .
If you are looking for comfort and relaxation , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy the trip .
However , the better option is to pick a train .
There is n't comparison with watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best part , the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine off some days .
Anyway , no matter how you go , no matter where you go .
The pleasure of travelling is travel at all .
Transportation is one of the most important things in life , so we have many different kinds of transportation . Now we travel by car , but in the near future there will be other comfortable and easy ways to travel , like fast trains and planes that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible
In modern society , there are lots of friends in our daily lives .
A big project could not be finished without co - operations .
Friends could communicate and exchange ideas , feelings and funny things that happened around us .
More importantly , parents give our lives and they give us the knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .
In this case , families play important roles in daily lives .
The reasons are as follows .
First of all , we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience .
For example , we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to make a meal from our parents .
Secondly , the families could give you some advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .
If difficulties were told to the families , the ideas would come to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation .
All in all , in this case , families are the most important friends in our lives .
Computing Technology has been advancing very much these recent years , making the old computers almost useless , getting better and making the difference between old and new computers grow even more with every new development .
As we can notice , old and new computers are vastly different , starting with the size of the computers . Old computers were much bigger than new computers .
Old computers used to occupy one entire room . Now , they only are the size of a box , even the size of a book .
You can have a portable computer now , and take it with you to every place you visit .
Old computers only let you do math tasks , or even play simple games with 2 colors ( green and black ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like creating or playing videogames , writing or reading a book , connecting to the internet , watch or make videos , invent new stuff to improve the Computing Technology , and not only in 2 colors , but thousand of them .
One of the greatest achievements of new computing is the internet , where you can connect to other computers , download stuff , etc . via Ethernet cable or Wireless Connection ( Wi - Fi ) .

I went to the abandoned house and started to think of the best way to make his life miserable . I spent the next 2 weeks looking for ideas to make him succeed .
As I did n't find anything , I went to the place where he lives and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he cared about , So as I continued to go to his house , I noticed he would always go to the same house so i decidec to follow him to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea , i would drive him crazy just as he did with me , that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him , but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they will be more united , so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death , jus as he did with me !
But wait a minute , am I really so angry about making this ?
Yes !
I screamed , my anger had dominated my mind . I did no longer have control over my actions . I was away from what I had become and what I could do , but I could not control myself and the only thing I could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisaction i would feel when i finally had my revange , the best revange .
But I was so mad at him and so angry at making his life impossible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the surfing I had been through became stronger and bigger . I had made a decision I was going to do it , if he dedicated 4 years of his life tourtoring me and not wanting me to be happy i would the time is nesesary for him to have a miserable life and i wo nt stop until i had acomplished my goald
I do not agree with this idea completely .
On the one hand , travelling by car is really much more convenient as it gives you the chance to be independent .
On the other hand , huge traffic jams are a big issue for travelling by car .
My Favourite sport
I wanted to be a football player .
For me , football is everything in my life .
When I see football on the television , I dream of playing in a big team and in a big championship like the Barclays Premier League , Ligue 1 or Liga BBVA .

I play football for a Portuguese club called Valenciano and we won a lot of games this season .
I dream of winning a lot of leagues in football and winning the best championship , the Uefa Champions League , and the best scorer of all time in the Uefa Champions League is Cristiano Ronaldo , my favourite player .
I play football because I like it , but the only reason that I do it is because of my dad .
His dream is to become the next captain of a big team and win a lot of money .

Public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe , but some people prefer cars to an extent we agree with and our reasons for that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay
Before about 40 years ago , there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars , so in those years there were not even good facilities to move from one place to another and that is because there were no companies to build cars . In about 10 years , car trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end
Nowadays , all facilities for travelling are more convenient , from cars to buses , even trains and planes . Some people prefer cars because they do like crowded places or because they find it sometimes cheaper , but from another point of view , public transportation is very cheap and even faster , but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places
To summary , it is different from one person 's opinion to another . I predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end , cars will disappear and will will no longer be used
The topic itself explains the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This conclusion becomes more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and the exponential growth in their sales figures , and with low - budget private cars in the picture , the scenario ddrastically changed in the past 10 years .
Development of the biodiesel industry can be a contribution to productivity growth .
A large scale of investment was brought for biofuel development .
Meanwhile , it boosts economic growth and job opportunities , thereby enhancing Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
If you are living in a big town or small one it does matter , but one thing should be taken care of by the people and the organiser of the town is the environment .
Global warming is a huge issue in today 's date .
The government should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down .
However , we the people have a really important part in making it worse .
Active and good governments understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment for their people .
Recycling items can be a good step to start with a clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taken care of by my city .
Everyone has to plant a tree in front of their home under the rule of the province government .
People do not realize that cutting trees can reduce the production of oxygen in the atmosphere .
Eventually , humans will have no more fresh air to breathe .
Additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public areas and those under 18 years old and provides a free session of talk or presentation to increase the awareness of a clean , safe , fresh environment in the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest our neighboring cities take part in cleaning up the environment so one day it can be seen in the whole country .
Everybody has his favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football .
In our school or villiage football stadium I spend a lot of time every day .
Usually I play football with my classmates .
Before training , I ran 1 - 2 kilometres and my legs get power and my body gets energy .
Our team has a hard - working coach and he gives professional advice to us on how to improve our football skills .
His main said , must work and work very hard , if you want to get high results " .
I can say that the coach is an experienced person .
Not so long ago , we had a competition .
First place was won by us .
We have achieved this result , because we are friendly and organised .
I believe that in the future I will be a famous football player in teams such as Skhatar or Dynamo .
Football is my life .
I want to give advice to someone who starts this sport must believe in yourself " .
Hello my friend ,
What 's up ?
How are you ?
How was your day today ?
It 's really nice to your expressly e - mail yesterday .
You regret that you were n't there with me . I 'll try to describe everything precisely , because I know that you very
Dear Paul ,
I have seen your notice in the academy newspaper and I 'm quite interested . I have no plans for this summer so I think it is a good idea to spend it .
I was born in the UK , so I could be a very good teacher of English .
Although I came to Spain ten years later so I could speak with them in Spanish if it was necessary .
Also , I assisted on a ballet course for 4 years when I was young .
It was a long time ago , however , I still keep the rhthym in my body !
By the way , I remember I had to create a dynamic training to do with the other ballet - course members . I had to be the teacher for one day and I did n't forget it because I felt wonderful .
All the members congratulated me , as well .
On the other hand , I took care of my brothers and cousins for many hours when they were very young .
You must know that I 'm a very responsible , kind and funny person .
That makes me a good candidate to achieve the job , or a hobby for me !
I hope you keep in mind my candidature because I 'm not going to disappoint you .
Best wishes , Julia .
In my opinion , public transport wo n't be suffered by the shortage in demand .
Because not everyone can afford to buy their own car .
Besides , there are lots of low income people who ca n't buy their own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What does " Family " mean ?
In my opinion , family is the place where your best friend can help each other and get to know each other .
In Taiwan , many people have to take care of their parents when they get old , but the point is what if you can not survive , I mean you do n't have enough money to raise your parents .
Back to the topic , I do n't know any members of my family . I do n't trust them , honestly .
I like New Zealand because there are many islands .
By the way , New Zealand has cool weather .
In Malaysia , the weather is slightly warmer than there .
That 's why I order all of you to go there and feel the pleasure and have a try their own food .
You can also buy a lot of gifts like key chains , statues , or else memories to be made before returning to Malaysia .
I did not have to go to New Zealand but believe me , it is a very beautiful place .
If I have sustenance , I will go there and bring all of you .
I live in Lentini , a small city in East Sicily .
The local Council hasn't a project for the environment .
People collect any kind of rubbish and throw it all together in a black sack .
Although the Council has begun to plan something , the people are n't committed to the problem .
Around the city , you can find many places where people throw frigo , kitchen , " amianto " , old things or furniture .
What a pity !
The suburbs of Lentini could be wonderful .
There are orange trees , a large lake and Etna in the background .
When I was a child , I had a lot of friends and they were very important to me .
We played in the park or we talked about our tastes , music , boys , we laughed a lot of ...
But when I was a teenager I began to live in situations that I did not like . . For instance , the girls said me bad things or they talked bad about me .
In those years , I experienced the worst moments of my life .
I remember when I celebrated my 15th birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party ; I think that this day was one of the worst days of my life .
That night I cried because I felt that I had not got any friends .
However , my parents thought that my party was the best and they prepared for me a special birthday and they invited all my cousins and together we went to eat pizza and gave me a lot of presents .
At that moment , I thought that my best friends were my parents and sister .
I knew that they never talk bad about me .
Now , my husband is my best friend .
He is the most important person in my life .
He has always been with me .
Also , he is very funny and I laugh a lot with him .
Both like to travel around the world and to do some sports , for example , tennis , running or trekking .
We like watching TV series and cooking various desserts too .
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially David , my husband .
The lives of people around the globe are becoming busier and busier day by day .
A busy life is always compared to using the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which has made public transportation systems lag behind motor cars .

Technology has changed people 's lives a lot . We can think how different our lives respect our parents or our grandparents ' lives . example , my parents did n't watch TV , because there was n't any TV in the world when they were young.but it is n't the alone difference : we can think at the mobilefone , the computer ed at least the internet.our grandparents woundn't imagine a strange machine like computer in their life .
Although the fact that personal vehicles like cars are now popular , in the future , the stance of public transport is still very crucial .
Nowadays , people use fossil fuels as the most important source of energy for travelling and manufacturing . This source of energy is n't always maintained at a constant level , but someday it will run out .
People must find ways to use other energy sources like nuclear electricity , wind power , public transportation such as the electric metro uses this kind of energy .
As a result , governments will invest more in researching the usage of these new types of energy . Travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than a private car .
The range of public services will be expanded to remote areas , it will become much more convenient .
Commuting , travelling using public services will be the first prior choice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly . In the near future , almost all cities in the world will become overcrowded . It will lead to many other problems to be solved , for example , traffic jams , air pollution .
In some perespectives , these problems are led by the over - use of personal vehicles .
People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time in traffic jams or to gradually killing themselves by breathing polluted air .
So the best way for them to travel is through public transport .
Each person should practice saving when using any source of energy to protect his own life .
In conclusion , investments in developing public transport will be increased considerably , public services for travelling have a bright potential and its stance in the future ca n't be replaceble
Hello Alex , how are you ?
Are you free for the weekend ? Have you have any plans ?
Me and my friends go to the cinema , and I invite you to go with us .
If you are interested , find me at 8 o clock near the cinema entrance .
Thank you Helen for those wonderful presents .
I always want to read these types of book .
I went to the temple in the morning , followed by lunch at the hotel . Latter in the evening , I went to the beach .
In conclusion , it is evident that because developing countries are facing political and economic instability , migrants travel for better education prospects and a stable environment for the younger generation to grow up .
The effects of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs , economic stability is affected as a result of the lack of people contributing to the economy .
The cause of brain - drain should be tackled at international and national level on a broader dimension and rational pattern , for it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on boosting the infrastructure and law enforcement to support the public in a positive manner .
There is n't enough oxygen at the top of Everest to breathe easily .
Jordan Romero turned 13 when he climbed Everest in May 2010 .
Mount Everest is so high that it is very difficult to climb .
The top was reached for the first time by two climbers in 1953 .
My friends and I , we like programs on TV , electronic music , fashionable clothes . I prefer all .
Sometimes we go to parties in the city . I dance in the parties with my friends .
They listen to music and can sing .
It 's very good .
Jason is my friend . He is drunk and also dances with his girlfriend .
Jose is the best song . He sings and talks in the party .
The other person is Angel . He does n't dance in all places .
He prefers studying at home .
Hello Something .
My name is Steven and I 'm 14 years old . I live in Germany .
At the moment I am visiting the Secondary modern school .
I 'm in grade 8 .
My life is difficult because I have to realize everything .
For example , there is a girl who is in my class . She is beautiful .
I love her look .
Her eyes look like the sun .
But she ignored me .
I hope I can forget her .
Run for your life
My favourite sport is running .
I like to running fast , so fast in fact that it feels as if I am running on air and my feet do not hardly touch the ground between the strides .
My favourite place to run is in the forest , but I like to run sportive too .
I love to feel the ground under my feet is soft so soft , not the hard concrete of the footpaths in the city .
The most advice I can give to someone who is starting running is to start slowly and not to try to run too fast , but then to eventually build up the running week by week so that every week you are running a little further and a little more faster and then after 20 years you will be an Olympic champion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Whether you are watching the news or a show about World War One .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television shows .
If you 're watching Tom & Jerry , it hardly has any educational value .
Although one could argue that you can always learn something .
A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie problem should happen , he would be prepared because he has been watching The Walking Dead for some time now - so in his eyes , he learned how ( not ) to act in that case .
Today I want to write about my job .
I 'm a forensic biologist and I deeply love my job .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
It is dynamic , stimulating and , even if it is not well remunerated , I feel satisfied .
In the last few years , forensic biology has developed many aspects like better sensibility , robustness of results and less time required to analyze a sample , but what struck me most is how fast this change happens .
Television seems to be a controversial tool .
Here there is one : does television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?
From my experience knowledge , I believe television covers both entertaining and educational functions .
It notes how many educational programmes have broadened young children 's horizons in the past few years , how quickly an adult learns different basics from a great large number of educational programmes , such as cooking , science and technology .
It also notes educational programmes make a decision on what citizens should know in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to possess .
Apart from educational content , there is so much foul content , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tell right from wrong .
However , I believe the educational programmes on TV still play a vital role in educating both adults and young children .
I think the best restaurant we can go to is " the sailor 's restaurant " .
Here we can eat typical Italian food .
The last time I was here I ate the best pizza that I have ever eaten in my life .
The atmosphere reminds the theme of the sea . In fact , the walls are decorated with a lot of shells and the waiters are dressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great idea !
Also , it 's perfect for our class because there is a lot of space so we can sit all together at the same table .
The owner is a very kind person and I 'm sure he paid us a reasonable price .
No future for public transport ?
Public transport is the cheaper way of travel , so it has a future .
Currently , most people are used to using their own car to get to work or to go shopping , because it is more comfortable .
But cars pollute the air with CO2 emissions every day and contribute to climate change .
So , if people were aware of this subject , they would n't use it on their own .
In addition , having a car is very expensive .
First of all , you need to afford to buy it . After that , you must pay for the insurance , council tax , and mechanic bills , and so on .
Whereas on public transport , you only have to pay for the ticket , you do n't have to drive and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use , breaks down , it is n't your responsibility .
Besides , public transport pollutes less than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has a future , and the more people use it , the more future we will have .
I 'm your employee , to serve in your company .
I am very pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
But pay is a little low .
I completed many tasks , including tutoring three students to complete summer homework , correcting homework diligently assisting the instructor . The instructor helped organize handouts , instead of the instructor to answer questions raised by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene . very hard , but I have nothing to complain about .
I worked hard for two months , paid a lot .
Your wage is paid much lower than I expected . I want a little higher wage , payment of 300 yuan more than the existing wage basis .
I invite you to consider the proposal .
I think about transport that the government has to help public transport , for example , buses , trains , metro and more , for only one reason : the quality of life against pollution .
Travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying for searching for parking and for the cost of fuel , and also maintenance costs .
In big cities , public transport works well because there 's good feedback from people .
Instead , in small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport companies , it 's not convenient to invest money , because fewer people would use it .
Tom Sawyer was a boy that lived with his aunt Polly and she had to punish Tom because sometimes Tom did n't go to school .
On Monday , Tom went walking to school and he saw his friend Huck . They talked a lot and Tom exchanged a tick for his tooth .
Then he saw a beautiful girl named Becky , so Tom talked to her at school and they went into a secret garden and Tom kissed Becky .
Tom said to her about another girl , so she got mad and she ignored Tom .
Tom was so sad because Becky did n't want to talk with him , so Tom went on a trip with Huck and disappeared for weeks .
When Tom saw his house , he snuck into his house and saw his aunt Polly crying for him .
So the next day , the people of the town went to church to hear the funeral of Tom because many people thought that Tom was dead , but suddenly Tom opened the door and got in , so everybody was so surprised to see Tom .
The next day , Huck went to Tom 's house to tell him that there was an abandoned house up the hill , so the two boys considered like an andventure .
So they went to the mysterious house and when they were inside they heard voices , so Tom and Huck hid and they saw that Injuin Joe was the one that was talking .
The two boys heard that he was planning to steal some money and kill people , so the boys started their adventure to stop Injuin Joe ...
Hi , Jo .
Thank you for your message .
I will do my best to answer your questions .
As for your questions , I think that you should work in a Japanese restaurant , such as Japanese " ryotei " and " izakaya " .
That is because you will improve your Japanese skills with them .
Recently , many South East Asians have studied Japanese in Japan while working in them .
By improving their Japanese skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to get a job .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
He was at Sarah 's house when suddenly he left all the bathrooms dirty and went to his house .
So he went back to Sarah 's house and cleaned all the bathrooms , but Sarah already knew that he had left the bathroom like this , so before Michael entered the bathroon she said : " I know what you left there " and Michael went running to the bathroom .
Hi Julie ,
My school is located in the centre of the city in Bangalore , India .
My school has a unique reputation for their friendliness and the quality of education .
I like my math teacher very much because her teaching style is very realistic and simple to understand .
Good Morning :
This is an essay about my favourite sport . I have been swimming since I was a child because I always enjoy it a lot and , what is more , I can do it alone . I never refuse to go to the swimming pool and less in summer , of course .
I do n't have friends who like swimming , almost like football or similar team sports , and I always go alone . It is n't boring for me . Furthermore , I prefer going alone because nobody bothers me or I haven't wait for anybody .
I said that because when I was eleven my best friend had been operated on and before the operation he came with me and every day I had to wait for her because she had a lot of time in the shower cleaning her long hair . I hated that !
Luckily the operation was fine and she left to come with me , and from that day I have gone on my own .
Swim is a relaxing exercise for me and normally there are n't many people in the pool , but sometimes there are children and I do n't like so much because they like disturbing me , but sometimes it is amusing too .
I would recommend people who do not know how to swim to learn , because I am pretty sure that they like it and later they can stop swimming .
I think that dance is a way for self - expression .
It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than that .
Dance is a passion , a type of life .
When I 'm dancing I forget all my problems , except my stupid companions that they do n't understand anything .
But this is another theme for speaking .
When you dance , sing , or act you are showing something to the public , something that 's important to you .
If dance is your passion , you practise every day , and you 'll keep practising all day until you can .
If you are tired , it does n't matter , because you like what you 're doing .
You 'll wake up early to go dance , or do dance classes .
It does n't matter if you go to sleep late , or do n't sleep ...
That 's a joke , you must sleep .
If you love dance , you 'll understand me .
Members of my family .
I love my family , especially my little sister . She is sixteen years old . I consider her my best friend because I usually tell her everything about my life .
I have a dog . Its name 's Chente . It is a golden retriver .
It 's a lover dog . He knows how I feel .
My oldest sister 's name is Cinthya . She is really weird to me .
Our relationship is not good because she is so different from me .
Also , I have a brother . His name is Jose Luis . He is twenty years old . His personality is dinamic and funny .
My mom and my dad , they are good guys .
Actually , I prefer to pass my time alone . I work in another town , so I stay away from my family .
Hi Mrs
Kate Ashby ,
How are you ? I hope you are well .
To work in our cafe you have to speak English , of course . Maybe you know how to cook some type of sweet foods like cupcakes , cake , cookies or brownies , the most popular foods of this year .
Another thing that you must know is how to deal with people . We are searching for someone who can impress everyone , also someone who can bring the customers good attention and service .
We need someone ready to work long hours , because our cafe is going to be open every day .
That 's all , see you soon
kisses ,
Fer
We think that in the future the planet will be in bad conditions and the trees will disappear . After that , we will have wars .
In 30 years we will have changed our anatomy , also we will be eating fast food . On the other hand , the north pole will have melted totally .
The temperature will become crazy because of global warming , so some people will die because the natural disasters will be more aggressive .
Technology will have advanced and maybe cars will be flying on streets and computers will have totally changed .
Because of this , we have to raise awareness of what is happening and help the planet .
Friendship is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
How to make friends and meet new people ?
It is easier than you think .
Just ... start talking !
Communication is the most important point when you 're going to make friends .
You have to remember that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing .
They just have to calm talk about it .
If your friendship is real , you will always find a point between your opinion and your friend 's one .
Just try , it wo n't cost you much !
Good day ,
My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport . Volleyball is one of the most beautiful sports ever and I have been playing this sport 3 times a week since 1980 . The reasons for my enjoyment of this sport are as follows :
1- make me fit and healthy
2- classy game no friction between players
3- it exercises all the muscles of your body
Regarding the above , I advise all rookies to start doing this sport and they will get many benefits .
However , adults can do it as well and they will get the same .
As citizens of a village , we totally care about the environment of our village .
Every Sunday , we do a mutual cooporation where anyone can treat rubbish as well as they treat themselves .
We clean the dirty ditches , sweep rubbish , then we bury rubbish .
Whilst , we recyling inorganic rubbish too .
From inorganic , we can make bags , hats and other stuff .
Then they can sell them and get income from them .
The creator of the haven and the earth , the creator of soles , the one who makes the earth rotate around self and around the sun .
What we believe as Muslims is that we have been created by one who does n't have others with him , the one who created our father ( Adam ) and created us from him ( Eve ) and they were in Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses , Jesus , Mohamed , others .. who they worship the same one ) with Miracles and evidence of the truth , to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell . so because of that we are here to do the test in this short life .
Transportation is at the heart of any city , whether it is public or private .
Nowadays , people prefer their own vehicles rather than
public transportation . Day by day , folks are more crazy about their own vehicles , which leads to a dark future for public transportation .
Firstly , I agree with the given statement that there will be tough times for public transportation in the near future.because people want privacy as well as freedom , which is quite impossible on public transportation .
Secondly , these modes of transportation cover
as much as possible in a city area or town , which mismanages the routine of travelling by public transport . In conclusion , generally , people avoid travelling by public transportation . Finally , I can say that there are various modes of transportation available
to competition with public transportation .
Nowadays , people have numerous options for travelling , like many private companies .
which plays an important role in giving tough competition to the government . As a result of this , consumers get more benefits like lower faire , privacy , freedom and safe travel . In addition , many automobile companies launcing new cars with affordable prices which insiost people to use more and more private vechile .
I go for a walk to a park every day with my lovely Corgi dogs .
I met many people in the park .
I never thought about people having so many pets .
In the peak time in the park is very busy even though the park is huge !
Some people are very friendly same as their dog .
But some people are very rude and their dogs are aggressive to other dogs .
Family is the most important institution of social life .
Every member has his own role and the boss , the father or the mother , has to guide his team to understand the right behaviour or attitude to have with life .
Usually there are generation problems , sons do n't understand parents and vicecersa , but dialoging and listening to emotions and facts , everyone can have another point of view .
Parents must give rules to sons to underline limits on social behaviour but also must listen to others ' points of views to ri - arrange and update their knowledge .
A mother or a father can be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone gives his contribute to family duties .
Recently I saw the thriller Mokingjay part 2 .
If you want to see that movie , you need to watch the first 3 movies before understanding it .
The first movies were amazing ! !
There is a lot of action , drama and romance .
The fans of this series had been wanting this movie ever since the first movie appeared . That was in 2012 .
I do n't think that this movie is for all the family , because it is hard for little kids to understand . In my opinion , I think it is more a teen movie .
I think people will like this movie because it is very similar to the story of the book . This is one of the first movies that is really based on the book . The theme is very unique and original . The actors in the first movies were perfect , and I think that in the last movie , they will put double effort .
Hope you guys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the las part of Mokingjay !
My favourite sport is Karate .
First of all , I enjoy it because when I practise I feel I can hold on for hours .
When I 've had a very bad and stressful day , I can relax by doing karate , because it 's the kind of sport that is n't very hard .
Training Karate is a way to forget your problems , to forget your tiring routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to find this advantage with other sports .
Apart from that , Karate is not just a sport , it is also a discipline . It teaches you respect , balance , even culture .
My teacher shows us how we should behave with others and he teaches us a lot of things about Japanese culture .
For someone who starts Karate , it is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to concentrate on what he or she is doing .
Technology is something that is very important , something without which we can not live .
Today 's topic is Technology .
Nowadays , we use technology in everything , from education to making clothes . We use technology everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful and important for development , but today 's generation is so influenced by technology that they have stopped doing other activities .
Last year , my friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition . He liked the idea , so he decided to enter the competition .
but there was a fee in order to join the competition . He had no money . Fortunately , he had a lot of friends who could lend him .
He phoned me and asked me to lend him some money to register for the competition .
He took the money on the second day . He finished the registration and started writing the story after a long time writing and did a good job . He went to give his story to the international student magazine office . He found out there was a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled , he came back vey sad and told me what happened .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake .
Travelling by car is n't so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the pollution of our planet .
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't any chairs for me .
On the other hand , in the future , maybe we will have a bus which has a chair for everybody and I would n't have to stand up .
Another transport mode is the taxi , like a car . It is so much more comfortable too , but it is more expensive than the bus or train .
The AVE or aeroplane are a good option for long trips .
In conclusion , in the future we should have a bus so it is more comfortable .

Dear Sir Dimara ,
I am writing about a problem in my city .
I live in Patras , a big city in Greece .
In my city , all schools and some walls of buildings are full of drawings and writing .
The vandalisme in Patras has increased a lot .
Unfortunately , when we say to somebody to do not draw the walls , they do not hear us .
For our city it is very bad because when some new people visit Patras they see that thing .
Patras is a very beautiful city for its culture , and for its monuments .
Why see that abaser thing ?
After we have this beautiful city , we have to maintain her .
In my opinion , the police should stop the Vandalisme .
If we had police all around the city , nobody would dare to do graffiti or to write something or to draw .
I hope you will do something about that problem .
Yours faithfully ,
Jessyka Stavros .
All around the world , pupils are waiting to finish school .
They are eager to begin a new life as adults .
But when they reach the in - between period , confused feelings cross their minds .
As a rule , after last exams , they do n't know what university to choose .
What they will do in the future they see , like in a fogg .
In this way , the idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonable .
Firstly , it 'll allow young people to have a rest after the first hard - work studying period .
Ten or eleven years at school make them tired , even pupils do n't even notice it .
But choosing the second education is a very important step , which needs serious attitude .
Secondly , such a year off would give future students a chance to try themselves in new professional sports .
Also , they would have an opportunity to be involved in volunteer activities .
And thirdly , they might work to earn their own money or travel .
This year 's holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and gaining new power for future education .
One year is not a long time .
But the benefits after a year off will be obvious .
I live in San Miguel Almoloyan . This is a village in the municipality of Almoloya de Juarez in the State of Mexico . Care of the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions in care of this .
People collect trash from their houses and await the trash truck that carries the trash to a landfill located outside the village .
Also , people go out to collect the trash that is in the kiosks , the church or in the principal places in the village .
Dear Sir ,
I am interested in improving my English , so I am writing to request further information about the English course .
Firstly , I would like to know how long the course lasts , and , if it is possible , the date exactly , because I need to book my flights .
Secondly , I do n't live in Cork , so it would be great if you could send me details of the accommodation that you offer in this course .
And also , can you give me an idea of how much it would cost every different options ? .
It would be useful if I could live with other students , because it is a good way to learn a language as well .
Lastly , let me know if I need to pass any level test before starting .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully .
Rosa .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , after listening to the conversations of his new neighbours .
They are planning to rob a very precious thing from the Museum tonight .
He did n't have much time to prove their plan and he could not wait to let it happen .
It is his town and it is his duty too to save the town 's history .
He called the police and informed them about his neighbours ' robbery plan .
Police reached the museum and caught the robbers red handed .
I believe that there is no future for public transport . Using trains is more convenient and lowers expenses . it also decreases the pollution gases which affect the ozone . People should be aware of the effect of using public transport on the economy and environment . Governments shall encarge the people to use the other ways for transport , this subject shall be issuesd in all media to learn and encrage the people to use he wrigth way for transpot .
Hello Estela !
How are you ? I hope you are well .
I 'm writing because I want to tell you about my last summer holiday .
I went to Las Hurdes .
I stayed about one week at my boyfriend 's .
I had a wedding .
While I was there , I did a lot of things .
One day , I visited Meandro del Melero .
It was beautiful .
And there was a wonderful view .
The other day , I walked a lot and at the end of the way , we found a waterfall .
The name of the waterfall was Chorrituelo .
It was spectacular .
On the wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very late .
The wedding was in the morning , and in the afternoon we ate in the restaurant with other people .
However , in the night , we had dinner in a garaje and there was a party all night .
You should visit Las Hurdes . It is a beautiful site .
And there are a lot of things .
And the people are very nice .
English is an international language which has become important for the modern world .
In China , English is taken to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn .
They begin to study English at an early age .
They use at least one hour to learn English a day .
Even kids in kindergarten have begun learning simple words .
That 's a good phenomenon , for English is essential nowadays .
In addition , some people think English is superior to Chinese .
In my opinion , though English is of great significance , English is , after all , a foreign language .
It is hard for people to see eye to eye .
English does help us read English original works , but Chinese helps us learn a true China .
Only by characters Chinese literature can send off its brilliance .
Learning a country 's culture , especially its classic culture , the first thing is learning its language .
Because we are Chinese , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our own culture through a foreign language ?
I was , last month , in a fantastic restaurant , Woolypools .
It is small but comfortable and famous for its big burguers .
Woolypools is a special meal . It 's a meal restaurant .
In my opinion , the restaurant could be better with respect to meat , but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends .
I expected to be more famous , better and biggest .
The problem with the restaurant is the place . It is far from the people and cities , and the space is very small for lots of people .
In life we have many things that make us happy and make our lives go on .
For example , a present or a gift , especially if it is from your best friend .
Once , I got sick and stayed at the general hospital , and my friend gave me a flower .
It was my favorite flower I have ever had .
In my town we created a small organization to more healthy environment , beautiful and to be attractive . The citizens in the town must participate in this . The citizens will take the responsibility for a specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into the correct place and clean tree and plant more of it .
I agree with the opinion that famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
It is horrible to have a person behind you all the time . You do not have a life , not peace , not joy .
In addition , all pearsons have the right to privacy and to be free .
Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo , all the time , when they are eating , drinking , happy , sad , how is your love life and with whoever stay , if they stay with something important .
This is terrible . You do not have privacy and society has blame , because if they do not take a photo , they follow the lives of famous people .
So that , politicians and film stars will have to support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then have the reward with what they earn .
That is all .
Good morning .
How are you ?
come here .
Get down .
Get in to the room .
Get on to the bus .
Let us walk .
Let us play cards .
Let us sleep .
Let me in .
Let me go .
Let me see your photos .
Let me watch your house .
Let me allow you to enter your cabin .
Forgive me . :
Bring that toy .
bring a glass of water .
Drink water .
Eat food .
Run fast .
stop shouting . Do n't shout .
Let us bath .
Once upon a time there was one little ant called Penny . He was really small compared with the others .
He hated to be like that because most of the ants made fun of him until one day something horrible and inevitable happened .
It was a dark night it was raining until a big active volcano explosion buried them into the underground .
All of them tried to find a way out ! , but no one could find one ... They started to get panicked !
People just started to evacuate rapidly until there was a big earthquake ...
Penny was so sad , the only thing that he could do was to wait and keep calm .
Until dawn all of them go out , so they sacred until they find a refuge .
Everyone wanted to witness the queen , but no one found anything .
Like they were very religious ants , they preyed on their sacred ancestors so they could help them in the big deal .
Something that they did know was that the whole thing was a movie !
So all was planned ...
The actors had monitors that watched the ants all the time .
One day , Penny discovered it and it went to tell it to its queen . The queen knew that she was very confused , but at the same time she got mad and she wanted revenge .
So they made a plan to display all ...
The next day , when they were about to start filming , they saw no ants there so they searched for them , but they could n't find them ...
At that moment , the ants and Penny attack them on their backs , making them to leave the place .
The ants win the war and they expand their habitat to the studio .
No one attacks them again and they live happily ever after !
I have many favorite sports .
One of them I 'm keen on playing basketball the best . I always spend more time on playing it .
I usually play basketball at least thirty minutes per day .
After a hard day at university , I go home and then I go to the stadium to play it .
One thing makes sure that I have already finished all of my work before I play my favorite sport .
Basketball has many benefits , not for me but also for everyone .
It makes me feel relaxed and unwound .
Besides , it also helps me keep fit and have a good body shape .
I really cra
zy about playing it .
When I have spare time , I often gather my friends to watch basketball matches on television .
I often play basketball at the stadium in the morning .
Sometimes , I play it near the sports centre .
I went back home and fell asleep deeply when I finished it .
Basketball is an outdoor activity .
That 's the reason why basketball is my favorite sport .
With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of the population , agricultueal land , forest and ocesn have been used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even humans and animals .
To start with , there are a wide range of troublesome that may lead to this phenomenon .
Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the present cities are already packed with places of residence , commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce .
Additionally , people now continue to destroy more agriculture and forests in order to satisfy all their needs , which will distory the ecosystem diversity and biodiversity , especially the endangered species .
Because to the problems above , various approaches should be adopted to deal with this . First of all , reducing building construction from now on , planting more trees instead .
Sustainadle development should be awaness to all humans and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phenomenon and problems should be worked out to resolve before things get worse and the governments have to take the responsibility for that .
Nowadays , languages are very important , and more English .
This is not my first time studying English .
I have been studying English since I was a child and I have never spoken and learned so well since I decided to go to London one course to learn this language .
I took that decision because I was tired of trying to learn English and I did not have the level that I wanted , so when I heard about that opportunity , I said yes .
The car is n't the best way to transport , because it produces pollution . However , public transport is better for doing a journey .
It can carry many people without problems .
Nowadays , in the cities developed , there are many possibilities for public transport , like buses , trains , subway , trams etc.these options are are more economical than the car . The problem with the car is that , normally , the car is occupied by a person , when the car is prepared for to carry four or five people .
This situation creates pollution for the environment , so we have more conscience for the planet 's health .
I want to say something about the learning of the English language . is hard to get to me for the following reasons :
The first reason ; the grammar that the learners , teachers or institutes teach , is like the Spanish Languaje , my native Languaje .
That I want to say , it is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb 's in Spanish Languaje . Just imagine the same but not in your native language .
The second reason , in the English syntaxis , the structure for construction of paragraphs or sentences , the verb is written before the subject , but not always . Which is the rule ?
Is there anyone ?
The third reason :
I love to play cricket .
I am enthusiastic about this game .
My favourite team is India because I belong to this country .
In India , 85 percent of people follow cricket .
In 1993 , the Indian cricket team won their first world cup and that changed the direction of the air in favour of cricket and everyone started to follow this game .
I love this game because it is my favourite sport .
His name is Mr. Sachin Ramesh Tendulakar , known as little master .
Whenever I play this game , I always follow this person .
His stance , style , shots , running between the wickets , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .
Not only me , but also every Indian always follows Sachin for cricket .
When he was 18 , he played his first game for India .
He is the first player who played 200 tests .
He has many achievements , like first 200 in one day etc .
I love the way he played .
For a nuance , first they have to decide what they can do better , batting or bowling .
If the person wants to become a bowler , then concentrate on running , action , stance and , for batsmen who need concentration on lag and bat coordination , eye and bat coordination , discover some shots which become key factors in batting .
Also watch videos of some of the best players , like Sachin , Rahul , Sir Don Breadman , Hayden , Wasim Akaram , Brett Lee etc .
As health is an important factor in every sport , we also need to improve our health and stamina .
Dear Jo ,
I am glad to hear you are going to visit my country .
I am looking forward to this .
I can give you some advice on traveling and working in my country .
l hope you will have a good time .
The weather is neither hot nor cold all year . You need n't bring too many clothes because you can buy them here .
If you want to travel to this city , I can be your guide as I have a year free before university too .
This is a modern city .
People usually come here for shopping or eating .
There are many local foods which are very popular .
You may like this .
I also want to introduce my friends to you . We can have fun together .
when you have played enough in this city , and you want to find a job here .
I can recommend you to my uncle 's company to do a job .
Because it is difficult to get a job here if you are foreign and haven't finished college .
It may take a very long time to find a job and you do not have much time here .
You may consider my advice .
My favorite sport is swimming .
It 's because swimming is really fun .
Also , I think swimming can keep our bodies fit and it can make the people who swim feel cool when it is on a hot day .
The advice that I give to someone who wants to start swimming .
It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn to swim and also , when they become older it will be more difficult to learn than little .
So this is the advice that I give to them .
Dear Camp director ,
My name is Eider and I am 21 years old . I had read your advertisement in the newspaper !
And I am really sure that I am the person that you are looking for .
I am monitor in my free time , and I am looking for a temporary job to improve my English .
Neither do I have problems with working in a kitchen . It would be clear if I told you that my parents have a bar .
According to my age , evening activities are not a problem for me , and I have played many sports during my life , such as socker , football , ...
Waiting for your answer , Eider
The city where I live is a small village .
All residents take great care of the environment .
Organized shares , where everyone cleans up the village .
All residents segregate garbage thrown into suitable containers .
Thus , helping to protect our environment to make it clean and safe , in order to not jeopardize our various diseases .
In my village there are trash cans , so that no one throws debris on the ground .
There are sports places where you can organize bonfires , but everyone has to clean up after themselves and throw out all the garbage .
We have the ability to use renewable energy sources , because it is close to a wind power plant .
Recently , on the roof of the primary school were batteries and the whole school uses solar energy instead of electricity .
They organize monthly meetings on the environment , and residents participate in them .
Wszysycy residents of my village , they try to , so that our village was clear that they pollute the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in your own car is way more comfortable than taking a ride on public transport . There are several reasons to consider .
Firstly , the bus always drops by to get a passenger that takes more time than expected to travel .
Secondly , the public transport routes are farther than usual routes .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and has no privacy .
Finally , there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker .
However , public transportation is much cheaper than buying a new car and for the adventurer who wants to have an exciting trip then to see more action .
Like looking outside or sight seeing , to mingle and meet different people .
In addition to this , I also admire the bullet train in Japan , which you consider the fast and safe public vehicle 've known .
To sum it up , I still consider having your own car to be way safer and more convenient .
public future unless they have project to at least reduce the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passengers .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of mineral extraction .
More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To begin with , extracting the minerals will be harmful to our environment .
There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown .
In my childhood , I went there to spend my summer every year .
However , it will probably disappear if developed equipment were set .
Next to go will be the extraction of the valuable minerals , which will definitely lead to air pollution .
There has been an example that another town is polluted by the process of developing the minerals .
No one can deny that the pollution issue is one of the most important things which should be prevented .
Last but not least , mineral extraction will turn out to be a profound influence , especially , on our offspring .
To take my friend , Taylor , as an example , her homeland was over - developed and became an arid place when she was a child .
After she grows up , she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown .
In addition , she has no blithe memory of her childhood .
One problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it might bring to us .
Due to mineral development , many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before .
It seems like a sought - after chance .
Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is no more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation .
In a nutshell , based on the reasons and instances above , the disadvantages of extracting the valuable minerals outweigh the advantages .
Therefore , I do not subscribe to this decision .
Limiting cars on the roads would cause the disappear of poo .
The fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming .
Global warming is a serious issue . Higher temperatures make the ice caps melt .
The longer we burry our heads in the sand , the warmer the Earth will be .
I am learning English to improve the general quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially while cars are not flying .
Even if it happens , there are many people who ca n't get a car , because it is too expensive , not only for buying but for fuel , service and so forth .
Buses are more simple - you just buy a ticket .
And what about trains ?
I saw TV about trains in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see blue sky and not a streams of cars like it was in the film " The Fifth Element "

My name is Chew .
I'm 25 years old and I am from Malaysia . I'm an energetic , cheerful , hardworking and a considerable person .
I have 3 siblings in my family who take care of me all the time when parents are busy with their work .
During school , I liked to play volleyball and I 'm an excellent player .
We used to organise competitions and tournaments with other schools .
This is my favourite sport .
During my leisure time , I like to help my parents in the kitchen .
We cook varieties of food and dishes .
I enjoy the dirty and oily hands in the kitchen .
With reference to the above , I would like to apply for the Summer Camp job with my full commitment .
Contemporary Art is a very controversial issue nowadays .
There are many sources and creators , as well as themes .
It is well known that many art curators and artists believe that Contemporary Art is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based on their easy ideas of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea , but most of the time this is unintelligible .
Luckily , the most expensive art is still old , like Picasso or Freud .
Nowadays , a lot of empty art pieces are being sold at auctions around the world , for extraordinary high prices .
Experimental Art has taken the world of art by surprise .
Humanity has reached a level of differences that it would not be possible to stop .
So now we have many choices and an infinity of information available at any given time .
With this stated , we now have an idea of how artists create .
The sports days were held at Kwai Chung Sports Ground on 12th and 13 th November .
The weather was partly cloudy .
I got there by MTR .
I arrived at the sports ground at 7:40 a.m. This year I joined the 100-metre race .
On the first day before the sports day begins , we have the opening ceremony .
The athletic representative pasted the torch and we sang the anthem .
After that , the sports day began formally .
At 10:45 a.m. , the girls 's grade C 100-metre race started .
There was a funny thing when I went to the marshal .
The teacher called my name twice and he told me to stand in a different place .
So I knew that there was someone whose name is the same as mine .
Near the race , I was very nervous .
When I was running , I heard my housemates cheering and the wind passing my face .
That feeling was very comfortable and made me feel relaxed .
Finally , I got number 10 out of 27 people .
Although it is not a great result , I 've already tried my best .
At the end of the day , our school announced the marks the four houses have got .
My house which got number two temporarily .
I felt hopeful and wanted my house to get the championship .
On the second day , my classmates called me to take part in the Inter - class relay race .
I felt very afraid because I was not good at running .
Finally , our class got the first runner up .
We have a difference of 0.5 seconds is the first of the race .
I implicated my class from winning the championship .
Finally , my house got the second runner up .
I hope my house will get the championship next year .
" There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
In my opinion , this affirmation is not correct .
We should use public transport because at present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and , unfortunately , we are harming the environment and the world .
It is best that all people go to the place walking or running . On the other hand , it is healthier .
There is nothing wrong with going to place in a car . Obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper , but not always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient , but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
It is commonly - debated that tourism has greatly influenced , not only the aspects of one country , but of the whole world alone .
Whether tourism has had a positive or a negative impact on our lives , it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorants .
First of all , tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world .
Alongside with its development , the ability to travel has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen .
Secondly , tourism , especially in developed countries , has played an important part in their growth from an economic point of view .
There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the economy relies merely on tourism .
If tourism influences the economy , it thereby influnces the environment , and if it influences the environment , it influences transport . People become more careful about their historical sites , in this means preserving transport is developed both at a small and a large scale :
At a small scale , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently .
At a large scale , people can now travel in almost any possible way : on land , at sea or by air .
Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations .
One upon a time , there was a tiger who lived in a beautiful landscape with her boyfriend and her 3 daughters .
The tiger was a girl named Amanda who was 25 years old . The herders killed her parents , because the herders were poor and did n't have enough food to survive , so they killed them .
The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion named John . 27 years old . His dad died because in a conflict with other animals , he got an infection .
Her mom died because some things or someone drag her by the leg and dropped her in a cave where other animals eat her .
They died when John was too little to remember and he never know what happened , so he went to all the parts to see them even he walked and walked even in reverse , but he never found them .
The 3 daughters were so different from each other .
The first one is named Amanda Junior , like her mom , but she is a cheetah . She is 9 years old . She loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and has a lot of spots .
She is of the ones that trend to make something enforcing .
The second daughter 's named Elizabeth , is a leopard , is the most intelligent of the family and the oldest of the daughters .
I am 12 years old .
Another animals gave them rewards or bonus because she discovered that water was liquid .
The last daughter was Ana , who was the youngest of the family is a jaguar .
She slept in bed and did nothing all day .
Their parents were angry because she was the only one that never worked .
One of the animals went with Ana and gave her an incentive to be an athlete or do something else than stay sleep .
The end .
Hello friends ,
I know you are searching for a flat to live in for the whole next year .
Maybe I found something for you : when I was on the bus returning home , I read a journal with some advertisements .
There is a nice flat near my home : it is perfect for someone who wants to live there for only a year .
There is a little kitchen , a great bedroom , a bathroom with a shower but without a bath , and a cool living - room .
I think that you have to bring with you winter clothes because here there is really cold weather !
Write to me soon
Alessia
Hello Riley , about the question you asked me in your letter . It has been hard to give you an answer because I know how much you love both .
Last night I made a decision .
I think that you should give up your music classes .
You have classes since you were nine years old and you already know how to play piano , so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in your free time you could still play piano without going to classes .
This is my opinion but the decision is yours , so when you decide it , please send me a letter telling me about it .
Love , Ines .
Hey , my name is Joe and I 'm 21 years old and I think it would compliment the summer camp very well , because of my good manner and I am very open to the kids so they can open up and speak .
My current job is to be a nurse at the local hospital and I can do everything as a doctor can .
So if the kids are going to hurt themselves , then you can fix them up instead of taking them to the hospital for small things like bruises and smaller injuries .
The most exciting day of my life was the 3rd of June last year .
I had an exam .
That day I woke up early because I was nervous .
Then I revise maths as at home , before going to school , as at school , before beginning the exam .
When I started to read the tracks I became agitated and I thought that I would n't be able to finish and pass that test .
But when I finished before time , I was happy and relaxed .
I always said that I passed that test and I was sure of that .
And this is true .
I passed that test !
Hello Charlie ,
I really enjoyed hearing from you .
Congratulations your sister for your prize .
I would like to go to a new artist rolls competition , although in my city there are n't a lot of competitions of this kind . If I 'd had a possibility of going , I 'd already spent the tickets .
My favourite sport
When I was three years old , my parents went skiing with me .
At the beginning , I went to the childgarden and they taught me ski .
It was a lot of fun , because I could not do it .
At twelve o'clock in the daytime , my parents took me with them and we drove together .
My father took me between his knies , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
When I was older , I could get better . My dream was:"SNOWBOARDING " , but I should learn skiiing perfectly like my parents .
Later , when I was 16 years old , my dream came true .
I went for my first time snowboarding and I loved it .
I took every free minute to ride snowboarding .
That was the story why I went snowboarding .
I enjoy snowboarding , because you feel free when you are driving down the piste .
You are like a bird .
It is the best feeling in the world .
You are very happy and sometimes I sing a song and the world is perfect .
That is everything I want to have and I 'm lucky .
That 's why I like winter more than summer .
Snowboarding or skiing is the best sport for everyone who wants to come to other thoughts .
Although you are all the time in nature and when you are lucky , you can see animals .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
Yesterday , he was on his way home and it was getting dark .
His parents were worried and called him a couple of times .
He started walking very quickly .
Everything was dark .
She opened her eyes and the first thing that she saw was the black sky .
A dark sky without stars .
She got up and looked around .
She was in a part of the woods where she used to go to think and relax .
She started to take consciousness although she could n't remember how she arrived there .
She had to walk at least 15 minutes to get from her house to this place .
The problem is the last thing she remembers is that she had been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wind .
She fell asleep again , didn't she ?
If she did , how did she manage to walk there in her sleep ?
If she was n't awake , why n't she remember anything after that ?
This situation was really fustrating , not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and back to sleep .
She started to walk to clear her mind .
She knows her way even in the dark ; she has been to this spot a lot of times , especially the last few weeks .
The development of human kind in technology is seen everywhere .
In the case of transportation technology , in the twenty - first century we have various options , like plans that can fly in the cloud , trains that are fast and big enough to carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of miles an hour and boats that are much bigger and faster than ancient time .
Although compared to ancient times , we are lucky enough that we have all these options .
However , if I am given the option to choose between all of three , I will say plane .
There are three reasons to choose this .
The first reason is its speed . Compared to both other means of transportation , it can travel faster .
It can travel thousands of miles in a couple of hours .
As a result , people can save time .
Second is safety . Compared to others , the chances of accidents are less .
That makes it safer to travel by plane rather than train or boat .
The third one is comfort level .
plan is much more comfortable than both train and boat .
In conclusion , I will say that plan will be my first choice in all three means of transportation .
The reason behind my choice is speed , safety and comfort level . That makes plan my first choice .
Everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university , to earn money or travel . It would be the best award for a student who attended high school .
Young people want to discover the world and travel to reach places which would be unreachable otherwise
I had a wonderful day yesterday because I was at the beach all afternoon .
I went with my parents and my sister .
The beach is located in A Guarda and its name is O Muiño .
There are a lot of people at the beach .
The water was very cold and I could n't swim , then I played football on the sand of the beach .
I took the sun a very long time and then I went to a cafe and and drank refreshment .
It was a nice day because I had a good time with my family .
No future for public transport ? Is this a claim or not ?
Will we see on our roads public transport in 5 or 10 years ? That is a really interesting question/
I think that it all depends on development .
Now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by car .
Yes , I agree . If you plan to travel for a long distance and for a long time , you would prefer to do it in a car , because first you;ll spend less time , your travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have an opportunity to stop every where and for a long time , as you need .
But if we are talking about travelling across your city , would you prefer public transport or a car ?
I think that this is the guestion for everyone , and the answer ca n't be one for all , because someone can use public transport , and the economy by this , not only for money , but and the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple do n't like to travell with another people .
So , in my opinion , even after 10 years , public transport will be crossing our streets with enough passangers
Hello Lara ,
Thank you for your email .
My name is Mohamed and I am a 28 year old male from the kingdom of Bahrain .
I go to GYM and run on a daily basis to keep in shape and good health .
Looking forward to knowing more about you .
My village is the place where I live , so I am trying to keep its environment non - polluted and valid for life .
In order to attain this goal , I have to take steps and actions to protect the environment as follows :
No smoking in public places .
increase the number of tries and plants and punish the person who cuts them .
establishing the factories outside of the village .
protect the water sources and the sea .
guide the people and giving them information , details and guidelines about pollution .
I 'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant . Its name is " Lemon " I go there every week . It has different food from any restaurant . I 'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce . It 's an excellent choice for me and my favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I 'd rather " Vadge " cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy classical music over having a lunch about the service It 's very good and all staff are respectable I ca n't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It 's excellent This strikingly thing for anyone despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive .
Volleyball is one of the most difficult sports in the world . You should put your body in the correct form to throw the ball to the other side in the game .
I have twelve years practicing volleyball and because of it I met a lot of people who helped me to grow up in the sport and life .
When I was 10 , I chose to play with a group of girls older than me . They were good , and I could n't believe the experience .
Volleyball is my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I am in another world , in which I can be free and happy . . Apart from this , when I am bad , this is a distration of the university .
You should try practice . It is so fun , but I advise you , it is not easy at first , but you have to focus many times like you should do in life .
On weekdays , I get off of my bed at 7 in the morning to go to work , which startst at 9 AM .
I often go to sleep around 12 AM .
I usually play video games if I do not have any homework to do .
I am not a big fan of sports , so I do not play any .
However , I sometimes do skip to fit myself .
Michael woke up in the morning and he read the newspaper .
He read in the newspaper an interesting article .
The noticie was about a competition .
The competition is about writing stories .
Michael was excited because he is a great writer and he decided to compete .
First , he found an idea for the story and he decided to make the story about pirates looking for treasure .
He began to write .
The story was very good , but Michae did not know how to end the story .
Finally , Michael ended the story and he went to the post office .
Michael sent the story but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake . He did n't put his name and address .
Yes , I think TV can entertain and educate , because there are comedies .
Also , there are a lots of educational channels .
I think historical channels are very interesting , because you can learn new things about the past .
Comedies are so funny , so when you are sad you can watch one of them .
There are many discussions about the future of public transport .
Different experts had talked about this question and there are so several opinions .
People like to have the freedom to move comfortably and for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
Public transport is usually restrected with the timetables and you can only use the transport at the moment that the timetable lets you .
Because For this reason , many people do n't like to use public transport because they want to move themselves when they need to .
On the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is less than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the needs of people may going to determinate the use of cars rather than public transport .
Susan is a little dragon .
Her skin is colored red and green , red dots ontop of the green to be more precise .
She does that every day after school .
Of course , she also has a little brother .
His skin is colored red , just like father .
